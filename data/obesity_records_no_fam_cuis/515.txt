Over past 2-3 months the patient has had burning epigastric pain. 
Previous anginal chest pain per pt. was chest tightness , but given her history of CAD her epigastric pain has been investigated for an ischemic cause. 
The patient underwent PET CT 2 months prior that revealed an LvEF of 70% , no wall motion abnormalities , and inferiolateral and basal anterolateral wall ischemia ( reversible at rest ) , in the distribution of the LCx. 
She presented to her PCP 12/10 to review these findings and complained of current epigastric burning. 
She was sent as a direct admit for evaluation of ischemia and possible catheterization. 
PMH: GERD , HTN , DMII , CAD LAD/Lcx/OM , CVA w/ resolving Rt. hemiparesis , s/p CCY , osteoporosis , hyperplastic rectal polyp , ASCUS 98 allergies: NKDA SH: does not smoke or drink Exam: Tm AF P 46 , BP 138/70 sat 99%RA PE: notable for physiologic split S2 , prominent S2 , no murmurs/rubs/gallops , o/w normal exam. 
EKG: old 1mm st depressions v4-6 , I. Labs: troponin &lt; assay. 
Impression: This is a 75 yo woman with multivessel CAD with epigastric burning , possibly GERD but given risk for ischemia and positive PET CT deserves diagnostic catherization and intervention to relieve any pain caused by ischemia. 
Hospital Course. 
1. card - ischemia: The patient ruled out for acute myocardial infarction by EKG and cardiac biomarkers. 
She was continued on her outpatient regimen of ASA/BB/statin/ACEI/plavix. Left heart catheterization performed 10/25 shows LCx disease with an 80% mid LCx lesion opened to 0% with TAXUS stenting. 
Additionally , a TAXUS stent was applied to an 80% ostial occlusion of the OM1 with no residual occlusion. 
RCA disease was present with proximal 40% and ostial 50% occlusions that required no intervention. 
During the procedure the patient experienced bradycardia to 38 and SBP 86. IV fluids were given with recovery of systolic pressure to 90 - 150s , and HR 40s. 
The patient was asymptomatic during this event , and has not had any complications. 
The patient experienced bleeding after the procedure and integrilin was stopped after two hours of treatment. 
The patient has had no further episodes of bleeding or associated chest pain and is discharged in excellent condition on her outpatient regimen. 
rhythm - the patient was asymptomatic at a rate of 40s - 50s during her hospital course. 
Titration of her beta-blockade as an outpt. 
may be considered if the patient becomes symptomatic. 
2. GI - continue H2 blocker , switch to nexium if continued pain. 
3. Endo - Hypoglycemics were held until after the procedure and should be resumed on discharge. 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. resume your previous medications 2. you have had two new stents placed to keep the vessels around you heart open. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: 1. f/u rate control as outpt , adjust BB if pt. symptomatic from bradycardia No dictated summary ENTERED BY: CLARDY , CHRISTY ALVINA , M.D. ( BL29 ) 5/11/04 @ 11:47 AM ****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******
