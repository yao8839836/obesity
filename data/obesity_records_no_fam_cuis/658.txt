The patient was transferred to the unit in stable fashion with lines and tubes intact. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Initial postoperative period: Miquel Fry was extubated without difficulty and had reasonable saturations on nasal cannula. 
Chest x-ray appeared wet and diuresis was increased. 
The history of COPD and thus preoperative COPD medications were restarted. 
She was in sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of 110 and started on beta-blocker. 
She was given Toradol initially for pain and Percocet for break through pain. 
Gentle diuresis was initiated and in the initial postoperative period she was on the Portland protocol for elevated postoperative blood sugars. 
She was transferred to the step-down unit on 2/14/04 where she continued to improve. 
Diuresis was continued and increased as needed. 
She was on 96% saturation with 3 liters of oxygen delivered via nasal cannula. 
Her hematocrit postoperative fluctuated between 23-25 and the patient was asymptomatic. 
She continued to be followed by cardiology for the duration of her hospital course. 
Gentle ambulation was increased. 
She remained in sinus rhythm in the 80's and pressure was stable 120's/80's and oxygen was progressively weaned. 
Her temporary pacing wires were DC'd without incident on 1/19/04. 
She was followed by Diabetes Management Service for the duration of her hospital course. 
Chest tubes were DC'd without incident on 6/26/04. 
Physical therapy was consulted and they cleared her for home discharge secondary to elevated white count and low-grade temperatures on 5/20/04. 
She was pan cultured. 
Resultant culture showed a UTI and all cultures were negative. 
Wounds were stable. 
Diuresis was continued and increased. 
Miquel Fry had a postoperative echocardiogram on 6/13/04 which showed an ejection fraction of 55-60% , trace MR , trace TR and no AI and no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
She continued to progress well and was evaluated by cardiac surgery service to be stable to discharge to home with VNA service on 6/17/04 with the following discharge instructions.
