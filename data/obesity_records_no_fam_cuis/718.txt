The patient ran out morphine three days prior to his admission and presents with a two day history of chest heaviness and shortness of breath. 
The patient originally presented in September of 1997 with a right foot cellulitis and claudication at 50 yards. 
This was treated with debridement and broad spectrum antibiotics and subsequently treated with amputation of his right toe. 
On October , 1997 , the patient underwent a right femoral popliteal bypass. 
He was subsequently readmitted in January of 1997 for a left femoral popliteal bypass and a split thickness skin graft to his fifth toe. 
He was admitted again in the end of January through the beginning of April with a question of a left thigh wound graft infection for which he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. 
He was discharged to home and is now readmitted with chest pain and heaviness. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the above with the addition of hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and depression. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Wellbutrin 75 mg p.o. q. day. 2 ) Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q. day. 
3 ) Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q. day.

p.r.n. 5 ) Nafcillin 2 mg intravenously q.4h. 
6 ) Morphine. 
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.9 degrees , heart rate 92 , blood pressure 122/60. 
Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light. 
His neck demonstrated a right carotid bruit. 
There was no lymphadenopathy. 
There was no jugular venous distension. 
Auscultation of the chest revealed bibasilar rales. 
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops or rubs. 
There was a normal S1 and S2. Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , non-distended abdomen. 
Extremities demonstrated bilateral groin scars and the left medial thigh wound which was open for a length of approximately 5 cm with wound packing. 
The base of the wound looked well granulated. 
There was bilateral ankle edema. 
Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally. 
LABORATORY: Admission laboratory data revealed that the electrolytes were normal. 
His white blood cell count was 13.9. 
Liver function tests were within normal limits. 
CK was 70 and the Troponin I was 0.0. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service where he ruled out for myocardial infarction with CKs of 39 and 70. 
His EKGs however demonstrated marked T-wave inversion in the precordial leads. 
The chest pressure and tightness resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and Lopressor. 
His initial presentation was complicated by the fact that it was thought he was undergoing withdrawal from narcotics which he was using perioperatively. 
However , he ultimately underwent a cardiac catheterization on June , 1997 which demonstrated a 40% mid LAD lesion and 50% distal LAD lesion , 50% proximal second diagonal lesion and 99% OM1 lesion with slow flow , along with an 80% OM2 lesion and a 99% RCA lesion. 
Ejection fraction at that time was noted to be 40%. 
Given the patient's presentation , he was booked for coronary artery bypass grafting which he underwent on February , 1997. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively and had an uneventful postoperative recovery. 
He was maintained on Diltiazem for his radial artery graft. 
His course was only complicated by intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter. 
His thigh wound appeared clean with wet to dry dressing changes and there was no further evidence of active infection. 
The patient was followed by the Miter Highway , Field , Idaho 39369 Service ( the drug abuse service ) as well as the Plastic Surgery Service throughout his hospital stay.
