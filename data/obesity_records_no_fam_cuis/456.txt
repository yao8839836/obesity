Discharge Date: 1/8/1996 DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR/POSTERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67 year old woman with a history of atrial tachyarrhythmias but no history of coronary artery disease. 
She came in with an inferior/posterior myocardial infarction and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit after initiation of TPA. 
Her cardiac risk factors included tobacco , a question of hypercholesterolemia , negative for diabetes , hypertension , and family history. 
The patient was a generally healthy female who smoked and had a history of palpitations and atrial tachyarrhythmia as well as a junctional rhythm and AIVR but no prior symptoms of coronary artery disease. 
She had been followed by Dr. Fiermonte for complaints of dizziness with palpitations and a work-up including a 24-hour Holter in 8/5 with frequent atrial premature beats , short bursts of supraventricular tachycardia with occasional periods of junctional tachyarrhythmia , and AIVR which correlated with the symptoms. 
An echo in 8/5 showed a normal LVF with minimal mitral regurgitation and systolic bowing. 
On exercise tolerance test at the time , she went seven minutes stopping with symptoms of fatigue. 
Her maximal heart rate was 76% and she had 1 mm ST elevations consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
She was then managed on Procan alone with good result for her arrhythmia. 
She was previously on digoxin but no longer on it. 
She was active at baseline able to walk two miles a day without chest pain , dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ankle edema , claudication symptoms , or other symptoms of cerebrovascular disease. 
The morning of February , 1995 , she was in her usual state of health. 
She awoke at 11 p.m. on 11/27/95 with 5/10 substernal chest pain , no shortness of breath , palpitations , diaphoresis , or light headedness , and no prior similar events. 
She became nauseated and diaphoretic without radiation to the arms or back and no pleuritic or positional changes. 
They called the EMT and her blood pressure was 116/62 , heart rate of 50 with her chest pain , she had NGT spray times two en route , and in the Emergency Ward , she complained of substernal chest pain with her vital signs unchanged. 
There was no evidence of congestive heart failure. 
Her EKG showed 0.5 to 1 mm ST elevations in II , III , aVF , and V6. 
There was no recent surgery and no history of bleeds or cerebrovascular accident. 
TPA was initiated within less than thirty minutes following arrival. 
She was put on intravenous nitroglycerin , Heparin , morphine , and aspirin. 
She had a resolution of her pain within 45 minutes following the TPA with return to baseline of her ST segments. 
She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further care. 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Atrial tachyarrhythmias , hypothyroidism , and status post spinal fusion in 11/19 .  
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies. 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission included Synthroid 0.125 mg and Procan SR 500 mg q.d. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She had a twenty pack year history of smoking , currently smoking half a pack a day , and no alcohol. 
She lived with her husband and her brother. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature was 97.5 , blood pressure 91/48 , heart rate of 48 , O2 saturation 99% on three liters , and weight 115 pounds. 
She was alert , oriented , and responsive. 
NECK: Supple , 2+ carotids without bruits , and jugular venous pressure was 5 cm. 
LUNGS: Clear. 
CARDIAC: She had a non-displaced point of maximal intensity , regular rate and rhythm , and normal S1 and S2 without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , and non-distended. 
RECTAL: Guaiac negative in the Emergency Ward. 
EXTREMITIES: Negative for cyanosis and edema and 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Non-contributory. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her sodium was 141 , potassium of 4.5 , creatinine of 0.7 , her LDH was 290 , her first CPK was 53 , cholesterol was 222 , PA was less than assay , her NAPA was 1.0 , chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart failure or cardiomegaly , and her EKG in the Coronary Care Unit was normal sinus with 0.15/0.08/0.2 , 0.5 mm ST elevations in F , and no Q or flipped T waves. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit , put on aspirin q.d. , and kept on Heparin. 
We held off on a beta blockade given her heart rate which was often less than 50 with a systolic blood pressure of 80 to 90. 
Her intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned off and she was given some fluid boluses secondary to the low blood pressure. 
We started her on simvastatin for her cholesterol and discussed smoking cessation. 
She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. 
Her peak CK was 789 with an MB fraction of 79.2 and her troponin was 20. 
Over the course of several days , her CPK drifted down to 695 to 604 with MB fraction of 46.9%. 
Heparin was discontinued on 8/5/96 and the patient , on 2/23/96 , had been encouraged to get up and walk around. 
She did so without any evidence of chest pain , she had no recurrence of chest pain after this point , and on 8/5/96 , the Heparin was discontinued and she continued to be pain free with ambulation. 
On the morning of 2/27/96 , she had an exercise tolerance test , a modified Bruce , which was positive. 
She went seven minutes and twenty seconds stopping due to chest pain. 
There was no change in her blood pressure , her maximal heart rate was 89 , and the EKG showed 2 mm ST downsloping depressions in V4 and V5 that developed with exercise and persisted into recovery which was highly predictive of coronary artery disease. 
She came back up to the floor and we discussed doing a catheterization with her. 
At the time , we kept her NPO. 
An hour later , she developed 8/10 chest pain that was relieved with one sublingual and she was pain free before the EKG could be done , however , thirty minutes after that , she again developed 8/10 chest pain. 
An EKG showed 2-3 mm ST elevations in V4 through V6 with pseudonormalization of T waves in II , III , aVF , and V3 through V6. 
Her pain decreased to 6/10 , she had been restarted on Heparin , and put on intravenous nitroglycerin with her blood pressure tolerating it. 
She was given six sublinguals and 8 mg of morphine without relief of pain , heart rate was 60 , and blood pressure was 100/60. 
She was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory. 
The catheterization showed right atrial pressure of 1 , right ventricle 24/4 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 8 , arterial 110/70 , she had a 50% stenosis in her left anterior descending , and a subtotal occlusion of her left circumflex which was opened with PTCA to 20%. 
She was kept on Heparin for another 24 hours following the PTCA and then the Heparin was discontinued. 
She remained pain free after her cardiac catheterization/PTCA and was discharged home on 8/9/96 with follow-up with Dr. Fiermonte . 
Her TSH level was checked given her history of hypothyroidism and her TSH was 1.0. 
DISPOSITION: Patient's hospital course was without complication. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , ECASA , 325 mg q.d. , Synthroid 125 micrograms q.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingually one tablet q.5 minutes times three , and simvastatin 20 mg q.h.s. 
FOLLOW-UP: Patient is to follow-up with Dr. Fiermonte in two to three weeks.
