271212527 | PUO | 83130630 | | 128466 | 8/30/1995 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 10/12/1995 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 3/2/1995 DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA. 
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY IN 1988. 
2 ) ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE SINCE 1983. 
3 ) INFERIOR WALL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN 1988. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old man with a history of ischemic heart disease since 1983. 
He had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at this time and in 1988 , he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction and a subsequent coronary artery bypass graft times three. 
In 1991 , he sustained an inferoposterior myocardial infarction and persantine thallium study demonstrated a fixed inferolateral defect. 
He was well maintained on beta blockers and aspirin until September 1992. 
At this time , he developed symptoms consistent with unstable angina. 
He was ruled out for myocardial infarction at this time. 
An echo was significant for hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls and ejection fraction was noted to be 50%. 
Persantine thallium in September 1995 demonstrated posterobasilar defect with 60% redistribution. 
After this episode , he had again been symptom free. 
On 9/13/95 , the patient began experiencing substernal chest pressure , 10/10 , with radiation to the left arm with good response to sublingual nitroglycerin with total episode time of five minutes. 
On 11/23/95 , he had a similar episode for approximately two minutes which he rated as a 7/10. 
On the day of admission , the patient had a fifty minute 10/10 episode of substernal chest pressure associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea. 
EKG was significant only for non-specific low T waves. 
Patient was heparinized , provided with beta blockers , and given aspirin and nitrates. 
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and the plan was to do a persantine thallium. 
The patient continued to have pain of the chest at rest and was transferred to the Pagham University Of for further evaluation and cardiac catheterization. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above as well as significant for polio with subsequent muscle weakness of the left hip and leg. 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission were notable for Lopressor 50 mg q.6h. 
, aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , nitroglycerin intravenous infusion 20 micrograms per minute , and Heparin 1300 units per hour. 
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission were notable for a blood pressure of 112-116/64-84 with a heart rate of 53-75 , extraocular movements were intact , there was no jugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ bilaterally , lungs were clear to auscultation , and cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensity was non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , no gallops , and no rubs. 
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , and non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly , extremities showed no cyanosis and no edema , femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruit , and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocrit of 40.3 , a white count of 10.8 , potassium of 3.7 , PT and PTT of 12.7 and 55 with an INR of 1.1 , and cholesterol was noted to be 287. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: While here , Mr. Patcher had one episode of 10/10 substernal chest pressure not associated with diaphoresis , nausea , or vomiting and relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. 
EKG with pain as compared to old EKG demonstrated inversion of T waves in V1 through V3 and questionable inversions in III and F. These inversions were present on a 11/28/95 EKG but not on a 6/25/95 EKG. 
The EKG changes with the past medical history was most likely significant of ongoing instability of the patient's anginal symptoms and ischemic heart disease. 
At this time , the plan was for cardiac catheterization. 
This is a 57 year old male with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the past status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1988 admitted with unstable angina and recurrent chest pain at rest. 
Aspirin , Heparin , nitrates , and beta blockers were continued. 
Cardiac catheterization results were notable for three vessel disease but the bypass grafts , the LIMA to the left anterior descending , was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the proximal descending artery was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the ramus was occluded , and the left circumflex to the saphenous vein graft to the ramus may be the culprit lesion contributing to the patient's pain and EKG changes. 
The patient was continued on Heparin overnight post-catheterization and it was deemed appropriate to PTCA the ramus lesion. 
The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory on 1/11/95 for successful PTCA of the ramus occlusion. 
Post-procedure , the patient was stable and chest pain free. 
Post-catheterization , the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 106/68 and a pulse of 64. 
The right femoral catheter site was without hematoma , no bruits , and femoral pulses were 2+. 
Dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally and there was no cyanosis. 
The patient was enrolled on the IFH protocol as per Dr. Varoz and as such , received 36 hours of intravenous protocol therapy post-catheterization. 
The right groin sheaths were removed without difficulty , hematocrit at this time was 35.7 , and the patient remained in stable condition with complaint of chest pain. 
The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital day. 
Physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 130/80 , a pulse of 65 , respiratory rate of 20 , temperature of 99.4 , O2 saturations of 93 and 94% , and examination was within normal limits. 
Cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensity non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , and no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. 
DISPOSITION: The patient is stable upon discharge and symptom free. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. and Lopressor 50 mg p.o. four times a day. 
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Donn Humberto Breana Kissam at Ly Healthcare Dictated By: VERLIE J. EVIE SWANDA , M.D. UV35 Attending: JACKSON E. PART , M.D. RM7 OH912/5227 Batch: 29805 Index No. I5HRYI81AC D: 7/11/95 T: 8/18/96
