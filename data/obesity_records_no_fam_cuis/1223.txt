She states that she does have some mild shortness of breath. 
She was referred to Dr. Janay Stukowski for aortic valve replacement.

PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 137 , potassium 4 , chloride 100 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 29 , creatinine 0.7 , glucose 86 , magnesium 2 , white blood cells 5.50 , hematocrit 36.3 , hemoglobin 12.6 , platelets 196 , 000 , PT 12.8 , INR 0.9 , PTT 29.7 , hemoglobin A1c 5.8. 
Carotid imaging , left internal carotid artery 25-40% occlusion , right internal carotid artery , no occlusion. 
Cardiac catheterization dated 9/26/05 , coronary anatomy right dominant circulation with normal coronary arteries. 
Echocardiogram on 2/13/04 shows aortic stenosis with peak gradient 77 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2. 
Mitral stenosis with peak gradient of 7 mmHg. 
ECG not recorded. 
Chest x-ray on 10/10/05 was read as normal. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Brief operative note , date of surgery 3/25/05. 
preoperative diagnosis , aortic stenosis. 
Postoperative diagnosis aortic stenosis. 
Procedure aortic valve replacement with a #21 Carpentier-Edwards magna valve. 
Bypass time was 59 minutes , cross clamp time was 48 minutes. 
Two atrial wires , one ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal tube replaced. 
Findings , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve. 
Weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass , she was in complete heart block. 
A wires and V wires were placed. 
After the operation , the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit in stable condition. 
While in the cardiac intensive care unit , her course was complicated by complete heart block immediately following surgery. 
At that time , she had to be paced and developed a junctional rhythm in the 30s. 
On postoperative day #2 , she was in sinus rhythm in the 70's with occasionally paced beats. 
At that time patient was started on no nodal agents of any kind. 
Also , while in the cardiac intensive care unit , it was found that she had a low hematocrit and was given 1 unit of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit has been stable since. 
On postoperative day 2 , the patient was transferred to the cardiac step-down unit. 
While on the cardiac step-down unit , course was complicated by the following: As stated previously , the patient was on no nodal blockers upon transfer. 
She developed rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 3 with heart rates between 100 and 120. 
Because her epicardial pacing wires were functioning appropriately , it was felt that patient would benefit from a beta-blocker. 
Lopressor was started and the patient tolerated this dose of beta-blocker without any bradycardiac episodes. 
However , patient continued in and out of atrial fibrillation for the next two days. 
On postoperative day 5 , she was started on diltiazem drip. 
Once the drip was implemented , she was she converted to normal sinus rhythm. 
When the diltiazem drip was discontinued and her beta-blocker was continued , the patient as of today discharge has been in normal sinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours. 
Of note , patient was subtherapeutic on her INR prior to discharge. 
Her INR will be closely followed by Pagham University Of anticoagulation clinic. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: She was discharged home in stable condition on the following medications: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. 
p.r.n. pain , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. daily , Advair Diskus 250/50 1 puff inhaler b.i.d. , atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Coumadin of which she will receive 3 mg today. 
PLAN: As stated previously , patient is on Coumadin for her rapid atrial fibrillation. 
Goal INR is 2-3. 
Please draw her INR on 11/28/05 and then daily until therapeutic. 
Pagham University Of anticoagulation clinic will be following her INR. 
The phone number is 132-202-5576. 
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Stukowski , cardiac surgeon in six weeks and Dr. Adee cardiologist in two weeks.
