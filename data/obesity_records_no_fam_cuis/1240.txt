In 7/25 , he had an echo with overall contraction normal , there was inferior and posterior hypokinesis , mild anteroseptal , and diastolic dimension was judged to be possibly global. 
In 1993 , he had an exercise tolerance test consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
He went six minutes and seven seconds with a pulse of 70 and a blood pressure of 150/70 with typical chest pain.

His creatinine was 1.4 with a BUN of 24 , glucose of 106 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 99 , and bicarbonate 31. 
He had 190 platelets , hematocrit of 41 , and a white count of 5.4. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was assessed as having possible chest pain and was put on a rule out myocardial infarction protocol. 
The pain was said to be atypical but it was considered best to rule him out. 
He was also started on Ceftriaxone for a possible pneumonia. 
He had blood cultures times two taken which subsequently came back normal and a PA and lateral chest X-Ray , he did not have infiltrates so that was discontinued. 
He went on to rule out for a myocardial infarction and he underwent exercise thallium on which , on a modified Bruce protocol , he went eight minutes with a heart rate of 93 , blood pressure 150/70 with no ischemia but chest pain without episode of mild or reversible defect , and an anterior transmural reversible defect. 
Patient was told of his condition and was started on a beta blocker per Cardiology. 
In the hospital , patient developed some episodes of chest pain with EKG normal each time. 
His stomach had also felt ascitic lately. 
Cardiology saw him and did not feel that the pain was cardiac with a myocardial infarction.
