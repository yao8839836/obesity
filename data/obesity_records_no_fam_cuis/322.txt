CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary process --- HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: GI: The patient was admitted to the hospital for likely UGI bleed given significant anemia , guaic positive maroon stools and elevated BUN. 
She was transfused with 2 U PRBC initially , placed NPO , IVF and GI consult was obtained. 
GI took her to endoscopy and did upper endoscopy on morning of November .  
They found a friable ulcer located at an anastomosis site from her previous bypass surgery. 
No active bleeding and blood vessels were identified at the area. 
This represents the likely source of her bleed. 2 more units of blood were ordered to keep goal over 30 but she only bumped to 26.6 from 20 after total of four units initially. 
It is possible the blood was drawn distal to where IVF was adminitered and there could have a been a dilutional effect. 
One more unit was given for a total of five which put her over 30. 
Her HCT was monitored and stayed stable at 30 after that for the remainder of her hospitalization.
