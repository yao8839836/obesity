As you know , you were diagnosed with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. 
We helped you by getting rid of some excess fluid from your lungs , and slowed your heart rate down. 
We also started you on an antiarrhythmic ( amiodarone ) to try to convert you into sinus rhythm. 
After discharge please continue taking your amiodarone. 
Also please following these instructions: 1. ) Weigh yourself daily ( your current weight is 200 pounds ). 
If you gain significant weight , especially within one or two days ( e.g. &gt;3-5 pounds ) this may be fluid building up in your lungs. 
Please call your doctor. 
2. ) Please taking measures to stop smoking. 
3. ) Please check your blood sugar everyday in the morning before breakfast and record these values for your doctor. 
4. ) Please see an opthalmologist within 1-2 months for a check-up. 
5. ) Please take Lasix 80 mg twice a day. 
6. ) Please continue taking ezetimibe and pravastatin for your cholesterol control.

8. ) Please take 6 mg Coumadin a night and get your INR checked at the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of Coumadin clinic on 7/11/06 .  
They will then instruct you to change your dose accordingly. 
Your goal INR is 2-3. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory TO DO/PLAN: 1. ) Cardiology -- consider electric cardioversion in 4-6 weeks if still not in sinus rhythm on amiodarone. 
Please check LFTs , PFTs , TFTs ( last value 10/15/06 nl ) 2. ) Primary care -- titrate hypoglycemics -- consider switching from glyburide to glipizide given renal dyxfxn? 
3. ) Coumadin -- goal INR 2-3 to be managed at PUO coumadin clinic.
