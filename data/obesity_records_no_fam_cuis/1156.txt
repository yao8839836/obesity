737023301 | PUO | 82038223 | | 334026 | 1/22/1991 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 1/22/1991 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 5/18/1991 ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 59 year old white female with a history of coronary artery disease status post bypass in l988 who presented with atypical chest pain consistent with unstable angina for rule out myocardial infarction. 
Patient has multiple risk factors including a history of inferior myocardial infarction , smoking history , family history , and age. 
She does not have diabetes mellitus or increased cholesterol. 
In 1/24 , she had an inferior myocardial infarction and had a catheterization in April of l988 showing 70% left anterior descending , 50% right circumflex , and l00% right coronary artery lesion with an ejection fraction of 80%. 
In l988 , she had three vessel coronary artery bypass graft with a LIMA to her left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to her OMB2 and right coronary artery. 
The patient also has a history of peptic ulcer disease diagnosed with melena in 3/10 and had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing antral gastritis. 
In 11/23 , she had a colonoscopy that showed diverticula and she has a history of chronic anemia with a hematocrit in the mid to high twenties and an MCV of 68. Patient was treated with H2 blockers and iron but stopped secondary to constipation. 
In 7/18 , the patient again presented with orthostatic changes and shortness of breath with pain to her arm similar to her previous myocardial infarction pain. 
Her hematocrit at that time was 20.8. 
She was transfused three units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix and H2 blockers. 
She ruled out for myocardial infarction and had a catheterization in 7/18 that showed patent LIMA to her left anterior descending , her left anterior descending native vessel was free of disease , and a 50% long proximal circumflex lesion as well as a proximal OM2 lesion that was narrowed to 70% at its origin. 
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy at that time was negative and the patient was discharged home for colonoscopy with Small Bowel Follow-Through that was never done. 
In the interval period prior to admission , the patient was in her usual state of fair health when she had an hour of chest pain in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening per week. 
She also noted several episodes at rest principally with increased anxiety and with confusion. 
The patient presented to CHH with a thirty minute history of substernal chest pressure that was not responsive to sublingual Nitroglycerin and was associated with diaphoresis and mild shortness of breath. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease as described above , peptic ulcer disease as above , left neck basal carcinoma in l986 , chronic iron deficiency anemia , history of biliary colic and hiatal hernia , history of chronic vertigo , and history of a thyroid nodule in the past. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her blood pressure was l22/90 , pulse of 90 , respiratory rate of l6 , and temperature 98.2. 
HEENT: Unremarkable. 
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. 
NECK: Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly. 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Showed non-displaced point of maximal intensity , regular rate and rhythm with a positive S4. 
There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
She had 2+ carotid pulses without bruits. 
ABDOMEN: Showed active bowel sounds and was obese , soft , and non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. 
EXTREMITIES: Showed 2+ femoral , radial , and dorsalis pedis pulses without bruits. 
She had no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
RECTAL: Showed normal tone without masses and was guaiac negative. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly non-focal and within normal limits. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , she had a hematocrit of 27.0 with a white count of 6.9 and an MCV of 63. 
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with axis of 20 degrees , intervals of 0.l6 , 0.08 , and 0.40 with a Q wave in III , and T wave inversions in III , V3 , and Vl-V4. 
These were all unchanged from her previous EKG from 5/6 HOSPITAL COURSE: Remarkable only for a rule out myocardial infarction in which she had serial CK and EKG that were completely within normal limits. 
Her CK were l54 , 482 , and 592 with normal MB fractions most consistent with either a very small myocardial infarction or , more likely , CK leak from some other source. 
Patient had several episodes of atypical chest pain after being moved down to the floor and EKG were completely within normal limits without any evidence of acute changes. 
Patient was transferred to the floor on September and her significant laboratory data included a white blood cell count of 5.89 , hematocrit 34 , platelets 458 , and MCV of 68. Calcium was 9.4 , magnesium 2.6 , sodium l37 , potassium 4.6 , chloride l03 , bicarbonate 22 , BUN l8 , creatinine l.l , and glucose 9l. 
Serial CK were l54 , 482 , 592 , 553 , 464 , and 3l2 , with MB fractions all less than l0. 
Her iron was l4 and her TIBC was 479 with a ferritin pending. 
Urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells with 3+ bacteria and a urine culture showed greater than l00 , 000 E. coli. 
This was treated with Bactrim. 
On July , the patient had no more episodes of chest pain and had an exercise stress test on which he went nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol stopping secondary to fatigue. 
Her peak heart rate was 95 , blood pressure l75/75 without chest pain , and only unifocal premature ventricular contractions with her exercise. 
She had non-specific ST and T wave changes only without evidence for ischemia. 
This was thought to be inconsistent with ongoing ischemia and the patient was discharged to home. 
Of note , the patient is not an CHH patient and has no primary doctor. 
Therefore , I am going to assume her care as an out-patient in KTDUOO . 
Pending laboratory data includes ferritin level. 
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Exercise tolerance test as above and blood products received were none. 
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Aspirin , ECASA , 80 mg p.o. q.d. 2 ) Bactrim one tablet double-strength p.o. b.i.d. times seven days. 
3 ) Sublingual Nitroglycerin one q.5 minutes with chest pain as directed. 
4 ) Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 ) Iron Sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.i.d. 6 ) Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
The patient will be followed in my clinic in the next available and I have scheduled her for an Upper Series With Small Bowel Follow-Through to follow-up on her gastrointestinal bleeding. 
I started her on Iron Sulfate and have encouraged her to make sure that she takes this in order to increase her hematocrit. 
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT , URINARY TRACT INFECTION , GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED , AND IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA.
