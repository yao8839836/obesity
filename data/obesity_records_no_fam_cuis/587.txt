CT of head is negative. 
EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at rate of 117. 
There is a right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block present. 
There are also Q waves in lateral leads V4 through V6. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the general medical service for evaluation of syncope. 
She was monitored over the weekend and no arrhythmias were picked up on cardiac monitor. 
The patient underwent echocardiography which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 80%. 
There were no wall motion abnormalities. 
There was also noted mild left atrial enlargement and mild aortic valve sclerosis. 
Due to the worrisome nature of patient's history of angina-like symptoms , she went directly to cardiac catheterization , which revealed heavily calcified LAD and RCA. 
The LAD showed proximal stenosis of 30 to 40% , circumflex showed proximal stenosis of 30% and the RCA showed proximal stenosis of 30%. 
It was felt that this represented mild CAD and most likely could not explain the source of the patient's syncopal episode. 
The patient also underwent electrophysiology study which showed no evidence for ventricular arrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias as cause of syncope. 
The patient continued to have no arrhythmic events on cardiac monitor throughout her hospital stay. 
The patient tolerated the cardiac cath well and did well during the postprocedure period. 
The patient's diltiazem was discontinued thinking that it may contribute to heart block given the fact that she has a bifascicular block. 
THe patient was started on nifedipine XL. 
The patient was discharged home with close follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Seguin .
