In September , 1989 , he developed chest pain and suffered an inferior myocardial infarction. 
He had an angioplasty of his right coronary artery performed at that time. 
In April , 1989 , he had more chest pain. 
Cardiac catheterization indicated left anterior descending artery lesion. 
An angioplasty was attempted and he had abrupt left anterior descending artery closure , requiring emergent single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. 
He did well until August , 1996 , when he had more angina. 
Cardiac catheterization showed a high grade left circumflex lesion. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex was successful. 
At that time , his cardiac catheterization also showed that his saphenous vein to left anterior descending artery graft was patent. 
His ejection fraction was 68% by left ventriculogram at that time. 
In April , 1996 , he had more chest pain and his cardiac catheterization showed no significant change compared to his August , 1996 , cardiac catheterization. 
One week prior to admission , the patient had chest pain , which was quickly relieved by one sublingual nitroglycerin. 
On the day of admission , while resting , he developed anterior chest pressure with radiation to his neck , associated with some lightheadedness and nausea. 
There was no diaphoresis or dyspnea. 
He took three sublingual nitroglycerin with minimal relief. 
He came to the Emergency Room and his pain resolved after one inch of nitroglycerin paste , 2 milligrams of intravenous morphine , 325 milligrams of aspirin and supplemental oxygen. 
The total duration of his pain was one and one-half hours. 
He was then admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit. 
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were Atenolol 100 milligrams b.i.d.; Cardizem 60 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; pravastatin 20 milligrams p.o. q.d.; aspirin 325 milligrams q.d.; sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

Electrocardiogram with pain showed normal sinus rhythm at 61. Axis was 0. There was no significant change compared to a September , 1997 , electrocardiogram. 
His laboratory studies were notable for a CPK of 103. 
Liver function tests were within normal limits. 
Troponin was 0.0. 
Hematocrit was 40.7. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit with chest pain. 
He underwent a rule out myocardial infarction protocol with negative serial CPKs. 
He had no events on cardiac monitor. 
He had no further episodes of chest pain while in the hospital. 
On hospital day number two , he underwent an exercise test. 
It was a standard Bruce protocol and he exercised for 9 minutes 1 second , stopping secondary to leg fatigue. 
He had no chest pain. 
His peak heart rate was 131. 
Peak blood pressure was 200/100 with no electrocardiographic changes.
