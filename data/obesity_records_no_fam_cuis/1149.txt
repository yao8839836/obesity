RLE&gt;LLE. 
Area surrounding ulcer of warmth/tenderness. 
R foot films - no osteo LENIS - no DVT Labs: Cr 1.8 ( BL 1.4 to 1.7 ) HCT 37.5 ( 35-37 ) plt 253 , WBC 6.05 *** HOSPITAL COURSE: 68F w/ a hx of HTN , CRI , obesity , psoriasis presenting w/ RLE ulcer and cellulitis. 
Hospital course complicated by episodes of sinus brady to 30's w/ 4-6 sec pauses , asx , evaluated by EP , no need for PPM at present. 
** 1 ) R lower ext Ulcer and cellulitis - cellulitis initially treated with nafcillin IV for 5 days with improvement in both swelling , erythema , and pain. 
Discharge from the wound was cultured and grew out Ecoli and Enterobacter , sensitive to cipro. 
Abx were switched to cipro which would provide coverage for the gram negatives growing from her wound and also cover her cellulitis. 
She will complete a total abx course of 12 days ( additional 5 days of cipro ). 
There was an initial concern for DVT but LENIS were negative. 
Zinc and Vit C were added to her regimen. 
She will also need Wound changes with NS wet to dry BID. 
The ulcer is most likely due to poor wound healing in the setting of chronic venous stasis. 
It was also noted that she had very weak LE pulse so vascualar surgery was consulted. 
She was found to have + peripheral pulses by doppler , and follow up with vascular surgery was set up for her. 
She will also get umaboots and ABI at her followup. 
*** 2 ) bradycardia: to 30's during sleep. 
Pt came in on atenolol which we discontinued , esecially in the setting of CRI. 
No tachyarrythmia on Tele. 
Good HR response w/ actviity up to 70s. 
Evaluated by EP and felt that she was not a candidate for a PPM at this point , especially since her bradycardia is assymptomatic. 
It was felt that her bradycardia is most likely due to her OSA , and that she would benefit from a sleep study. 
If her bradycardia does not improve after treatment of her OSA , then she will need to follow up with EP for further evaluation. 
*** 3 ) ENdo - fasting glucose normal , HGA1C -5.4. 
*** 4 ) Renal - CRI at baseline. 
No issues during hospitalization ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. take antibiotics for full course , if ulcer or cellulitis worsens or does not improve after antibiotics please call your doctor 2. stop taking atenolol 3.
