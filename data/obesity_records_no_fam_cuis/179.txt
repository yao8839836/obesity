BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old man with coronary artery today disease status post CABG , diabetes mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , status post bilateral below-the-knee amputations , end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , and metastatic prostate cancer presenting with new-onset ascites. 
He notes that since his last below-the-knee amputation in 9/24 , he has noticed increased abdominal girth , smaller after hemodialysis. 
He denies fevers , chills , jaundice , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or bright red blood per rectum. 
He has had some weight loss. 
He denies PND , orthopnea , or lower extremity swelling. 
On the day of admission , the patient was in the preoperative area for revision of his below-the-knee amputation of the right leg because it had poor wound healing. 
During the preoperative evaluation , however , it was noticed that he had significant abdominal swelling.

PROCEDURES: 9/25/2007 , therapeutic paracentesis , 4 liters of ascitic fluid removed without complication. 
Chemistries and cell counts of ascitic fluid as described above in the laboratory section. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 63-year-old man with history of end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , coronary artery disease , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral knee amputations , who presented with two months of worsening ascites of unclear etiology. 
His hospital course by problem is as follows: 1. Gastrointestinal: The patient underwent a therapeutic paracentesis with ascites fluid revealing chemistries with total protein greater than 2.5 and serum ascites albumin gradient greater than 1.1 consistent with a transudative ascites , likely due to volume overload with resultant right heart failure. 
Ascites had 460 white blood cells with 20% polys. 
Therefore , it was not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 
Ascitic fluids were negative for growth of bacteria and cytology of the ascitic fluids identified no malignant cells. 
After consultation with the cardiology service , it was concluded that the ascites was due to massive volume overload , and therefore the patient should undergo reduction of volume through ultrafiltration at dialysis. 
This process was begun as an inpatient by the renal service. 
While the patient was an inpatient , efforts to remove fluid was complicated by development of hypotension during dialysis as well as by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with heart rates up to the 140s. 
Due to the difficulties with removing fluid at dialysis , the patient was offered the option of undergoing ultrafiltration by CVVH or an ultrafiltration machine , but the patient and the family declined to participate in such care. 
It should also be noted that despite our efforts , the patient was not compliant with fluid restrictions that were put into place in the patient's diet order , therefore also making it difficult to treat the patient's volume overload. 
The patient was discharged with the plan to continue ultrafiltration at outpatient dialysis in an attempt to continue to remove fluid and reduce the patient's volume overload. 
This plan was communicated by the attending renal , Dr. Fran Bussler , to the patient's outpatient renal attending , Dr. Desirae Marcott . 
2. Renal: As described above , the patient has end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis. 
As described above , ultrafiltration was attempted at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid as possible and to reduce the patient's volume overloaded state. 
Ultrafiltration should be continued as an outpatient to continue to attempt to counteract the patient's volume overload. 
3. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , the patient has a history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and stent , but his usual aspirin and Plavix were initially held given that surgical revision of his right below-the-knee amputation had been planned. 
However , after discussion with the patient's vascular surgeon , Dr. Jerica Youngberg , it was decided that the patient's volume overload should be corrected prior to his undergoing surgical revision of his right leg. 
Therefore , aspirin and Plavix were restarted on 11/16/2007 .  
Pump: The patient has evidence of right heart failure by echocardiogram. 
On physical exam and as described above , this is likely a consequence of the patient's volume overload. 
Again , as described above , volume was removed through ultrafiltration at dialysis. 
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated , likely for fear of noncompliance. 
The patient was in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of this admission but on 1/8/2007 , the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular with rates to the 120s to 140s. 
However , the patient refused to accept monitoring on cardiac telemetry and also refused to cooperate with the administration of intravenous medications for heart rate control. 
Therefore , the patient's dose of oral Lopressor was slowly titrated upward as tolerated by his blood pressures , but on discharge his rate remained in the low 100s and were not optimally controlled. 
However , the patient refused further management of his atrial fibrillation , and it was therefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatient with continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blocker regimen. 
4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on his home insulin regimen and fingersticks were monitored on a q.a.c. and nightly basis with adequate control of blood sugars. 
5. Vascular: As described above , the patient has a right below-the-knee amputation , which need surgical revision. 
As described above , after discussion with the patient's vascular surgeon , Dr. Jerica Youngberg , it was decided that the patient's surgical revision of his right leg would be addressed after his issues with volume overload are resolved. 
6. Infectious disease: It was noted that the patient has as a likely paronychia of his left index finger. 
Plain films were obtained , which did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. 
A hand surgery consult was obtained , and it was noted that there were no vascular issues with his left hand and that no urgent surgical debridement of the left finger was necessary. 
The patient was treated with oral levofloxacin and will continue taking levofloxacin for a total of 3-week course to end on 6/11/2007 .  
Oxycodone was administered for pain control of his left finger as well as for pain control of his right leg. 
Prophylaxis , the patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and placed on Nexium for GI prophylaxis. 
The patient was full code during this admission. 
PHYSICIAN FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has a followup appointment with his vascular surgeon , Dr. Jerica Youngberg , on 10/26/2007 at 2:30 p.m. , phone number 931-223-3069. 
The patient should call his doctor his primary care physician , Dr. Tarsha Prall , telephone #245-453-9949 , for appointment in two to three weeks. 
The patient will continue dialysis at Delpnecrest Ce Medical Center under the direction of Dr. Desirae Marcott on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday schedule. 
This patient should complete a total of 14-day course of levofloxacin to end on 6/11/2007 for his left fourth finger paronychia/skin infection. 
The patient's beta-blocker should be titrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for better control of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
As described above , ultrafiltration should be used during dialysis to remove total body volume.
