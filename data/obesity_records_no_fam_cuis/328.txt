The patient is followed by Dr. Bua for hypertension. 
Approximately one year ago , he was sitting on a bike awaiting an exercise test and he felt lightheaded without any chest pain. 
He was admitted to OCGH for question of rule out myocardial infarction. 
He had an exercise tolerance test one day later without chest pain or shortness of breath. 
He exercises daily as well as jogging. 
Two weeks prior to admission , the patient walked one block , he had acute shortness of breath while awaiting for a train. 
He had a head cold with congestion and cough at that time.

He was also given Lopressor , 15 mg. 
EKG showed Q's in V1-2 , 1-2 mm ST increasing in V1 , lateral T wave inversions. 
Blood pressure dropped to 99/67 with treatment and he was sent for emergent cardiac catheterization. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 , -15 degrees axis. 
There were left atrial abnormalities. 
There was ST elevation of 1-2 mm in V1-3 , T wave inversion in I , L , V4-6; Q's in V1 and V2.

The patient was stable overnight.

It was felt that an acute myocardial infarction was less likely and it was felt that pulmonary edema was secondary to his hypertensive disease being out of control. 
His heparin was discontinued and he was switched to atenolol and lisinopril. 
The patient underwent exercise tolerance test where he completed a submaximal predischarge protocol without pain or dyspnea. 
His resting EKG showed evidence of anterior septal myocardial infarction with a peak heart rate of 120 , blood pressure 180/90. 
There were some mild fixed defects anteriorly.
