Discharge Date: 7/7/1999 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Critical ischemia of the right foot. 
2. Stenosis of the left femoral tibial bypass graft. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Feltus is an 85-year-old woman who is status post a left femoral peroneal bypass graft in February of 1998 , who presented with right foot pain and nonhealing ulcers of the right second and third metatarsal joint. 
She underwent angiogram on August , 1999 which revealed right lower extremity patent superficial femoral artery , a 90 percent distal popliteal stenosis , and three vessel occlusion distal to the trifurcation , and a 70 percent stenosis of the distal anterior tibial supplying the dorsalis pedis. 
The left femoral peroneal had a long segmented stricture at the level of the knee. 
Retrograde filling of the left dorsalis pedis was identified. 
The patient presented for surgical management. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
2. Atrial fibrillation. 
3. History of deep venous thrombosis. 
4. Peripheral vascular disease. 5. Status post right hip fracture surgery. 
6. Status post suprapubic total abdominal hysterectomy. 
7. Status post left superficial femoral artery to peroneal bypass graft. 
8. History of diabetic nephropathy. 
MEDICATIONS: 1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Humulin 10 in the morning 6 in the p.m. 3. Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. 4. MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. 5. Senokot two tablets p.o. q.d. 6. Vitamin C 500 q.d. 7. Trilisate. 
8. Verapamil 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. 9. Coumadin.

Her heart had an irregular rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
The abdomen was soft , round , non-tender , nondistended , bowel sounds were present. 
Extremities of the extremities identified superficial ulcers between the right second and third metatarsals. 
Vascular examination , on the right side the right femoral pulse was palpable , popliteal was 2+ dopplerable , dorsalis pedis was 1+ dopplerable , and posterior tibial could not be dopplered. 
On the left , the femoral pulse was 2+ palpable , popliteal was 2+ palpable , the dorsalis pedis had a biphasic dopplerable signal , and the posterior tibial had a monophasic dopplerable signal. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: On March , 1999 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent a right below the knee popliteal to anterior tibial bypass with a reversed cephalic vein graft. 
She also underwent vein patch angioplasty of the left femoral tibial artery bypass graft. 
Her postoperative pulse examination identified a palpable right dorsalis pedis and a dopplerable right posterior tibial; left dopplerable dorsalis pedis and left dopplerable posterior tibial. 
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction as per the recommendations of the Cardiology team. 
Verapamil and digoxin were continued for appropriate rate control. 
On postoperative day number one it was noted that her right arm from which the cephalic vein graft had been harvested was edematous , and the distal extremity was somewhat cool. 
With elevation this resolved. 
Her digital perfusion was excellent by clinical examination , and her neurologic function was intact. 
The patient was restarted on her Coumadin on postoperative day number two.
