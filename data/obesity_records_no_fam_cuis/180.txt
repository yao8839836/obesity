LABORATORY: Cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% circumflex lesion , 100% right coronary artery occlusion and the circumflex was subsequently stented. 
An echocardiogram performed showed a 40% ejection fraction with aortic stenosis , a peak gradient of 35 and a calculated valve area of 1 cm squared. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on August , 2002 for an aortic valve replacement with a St. Jude #23 mechanical valve and a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 to the LAD , obtuse marginal and LVB1. 
The patient tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. 
However , the patient did develop an uncontrolled left-sided nose bleed in the operating room and ENT was called to pack the nose. 
The postoperative course was remarkable for sluggish urine output for which Renal consult was called in to follow. 
The patient was treated with diuretics and her urine output subsequently improved. 
The patient was kept on pressors and mechanical ventilation for several days and was then extubated on January , 2002 after her volume overload was controlled. 
The patient was transferred to the floor on July , 2002 off her torsemide drip and tolerating intravenous intermittent doses of torsemide. 
Otolaryngology removed the packing from the patient's nose and she just had minor oozing after this not requiring any treatment.
