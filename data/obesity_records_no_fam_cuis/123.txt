Discharge Date: 2/5/2001 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Smolinsky is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post small non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in October of 2000 and also status post cardiac catheterization with 2 vessel disease , small left PICA cerebrovascular accident , congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in October revealing an ejection fraction of 30%. 
Also diabetes mellitus type II complicated by retinopathy , nephropathy and question neuropathy. 
History of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia as well who presented to Dr. Dimpfl clinic on May , 2001 with progressive increasing dyspnea , increasing abdominal girth and weight gain over the past few months. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus x 20 years , chronic renal insufficiency with the last creatinine in January of 3.5 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30% in October of 2000 , coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction , October 2000 question f silent myocardial infarction x 2 , history of hyperlipidemia. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day , Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o. q day , toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q day , insulin 70/30 65/45 , Actos 45 q p.m , Avapro 300 mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.. PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.1 , blood pressure 116/70 , pulse 88 , primary care physician of 18. 
The patient appeared to be in no acute distress. 
Jugular venous pressure approximately 13 cm water. 
LUNGS: Faint bibasilar rales. 
CARDIAC: Tachycardia , regular rhythm without murmurs. 
ABDOMEN: Positive , normal active bowel sounds. 
Obese , distended and nontender. 
EXTREMITIES: 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse , 2-3 plus edema bilaterally to the knees. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: It was felt that given notes of thyroid dysfunction , his history was consistent with fluid overload. 
His jugular venous pressure was elevated and he had 3plus pitting edema to the knees without significant rales on chest exam. 
He was aggressively diuresed with doses of Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. 
IV as well as Zaroxolyn. 
Weight on admission was 135 kilograms and on discharge he was down to 132 kilograms. 
A repeat echocardiogram at Pagham University Of showed an ejection fraction of 30-35 , left ventricular dimensions of 47 mm , 1 plus mitral regurgitation and global hypokinesis as well as moderate right ventricular dysfunction. 
Abdominal ultrasound showed no ascites despite extremely distended abdomen and right renal cyst x 2. Follow up abdominal CT also showed there was no mass or ascites and his distended abdomen was likely due to adipose tissue. 
Diuresis was limited by acute and chronic renal failure and oliguria. 
Diuresis was held from May , 2001. 
Right heart catheterization on February , 2001 showed mildly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and moderately elevated right ventricular pressures. 
Dopamine was started on June , 2001 to aid with renal perfusion and diuresis and he was then weaned off of that on July , 2001. 
His Lasix was stopped on July , 2001 and he auto-diuresed until the time of discharge with stable blood pressure. 
He remained stable with no dyspnea at rest and is symptom free at the time of discharge. 
2. Renal: His basic chronic renal insufficiency is likely secondary to poor diabetic control with a creatinine of 2.5 on October , 2001 , 3.3 at the time of admission. 
Acute renal failure with increasing creatinine of 6 after aggressive diuresis with a mean of 0.8 percent. 
Renal function improved with creatinine of 4.1 on July , 2001 with autodiuresis. 
The renal service was consulted to comment on the nature of the patient's renal insufficiency and acute renal failure as well as to assist in the use of vasodilators. 
3. Endocrine: He has a long standing history of type II diabetes complicated by retinopathy and neuropathy and nephropathy. 
He was maintained on his outpatient endocrine regimen during his stay. 
The patient was discharged home with services. 
He is to follow up with Dr. Rollinger on November , 2001 at 3:30 p.m. , with Dr. Raabe on August , 2002 at 3:30 p.m. , Dr. Spillett January , 2001 at 10:00 a.m.
