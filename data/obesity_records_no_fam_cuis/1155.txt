BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE: CC: Lightheadness , nausea --- DDX: Hypertensive Urgency --- HPI: 77 year old female with CAD s/p three stents , DM , HTN and CKD was sent to ED by PCP after she presented to office with malaise , nausea and lightheadedness. 
Her symptoms first developed on Thursday. 
She had checked her BS and BP at that time and they were 300 and 150 systolic. 
Her symptoms resolved but returned on Sunday PTA and persisted throughout the day so Monday she went to see her PCP. 
At the PCPs office her BP was noted to be 212 systolic and she was sent to the ED for evaluation. 
Of note , on route to the PCP office she had a fleeting episode of chest "cramping" which was unlike her previous angina or MI pain. 
--- In the ED: The patient received labetolol 10mg IV X2 , labetolol 400mg po X1 , nitropaste 3". 
Her BP remained above 200 despite these medications and then she received hydralazine 10mg IV X1 which resulted in dropping her BP to 150 systolic. 
--- PMH: see list.

--- CV: The cause of her high BP is not clear. 
There is no indication of med non-compliance. 
Her PCP reports labile BPs are a problem for her. 
Her BP was controlled after she arrived to the floor. 
She was resumed on her home dose of Labetolol. 
There was discussion of increasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary. 
In fact she was symptomatic with a BP of 120 in terms of feeling lightheaded. 
Therefore her hold parameters were increased to 130 systolic. 
In addition she had occasional ectopic apical heart beats which resulted in early QRS complex and occasional slight pauses &lt;2sec. 
No major events on telemetry. 
Her heart rate was relatively slow around 50-55 much of the time. 
Her EKG did show slight ( 1mm ) ST segment depressions in antero-lateral leads and her CKMB was elevated on admission. 
She ruled out for MI with three sets of neg troponins. 
She may have had slight demand ischemia in setting of hypertension. 
Her CKMB was normal on day of discharge. 
Her troponins were always negative. 
She had no s/s of CHF. 
She was monitored on telemetry with no major events. 
--- RENAL: The patient is a diabetic and in addition reports a recent history of contrast induced nephropathy. 
She had proteinuria on admission which is slighly higher than usual ( 3+ compared to 2+ ) but her creatinine was improved from baseline to 1.6 ( 1.8-2.2 ). 
A renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis. 
UPEP , SPEP and spot urine/protein were ordered. 
Her spot urine protein was 222. 
Her proteinuria in a chronic problem. 
UPEP/SPEP need to be followed up as outpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low. 
--- ENDO: The pt has history of DM and takes Lantus and Humolog at home. 
She missed her lantus dose the night of admission and subsequent am BS was high. 
She received NPH to cover her for the HD#1 and then she resumed Lantus that evening. 
She also received her home humulog and a sliding scale. 
She received a carb controlled diet. 
Her TSH was 1.2 on home Levoxyl. 
--- FEN: Her lytes were repleted as needed. 
--- GI: Her renal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder and a slightly distended CBD. 
Bili T and D were added and are normal. 
She had no abd pain or tenderness so her gallbladder sludge is not likely to represent a pathology. 
--- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Monitor your BP at home and call your PCP if &gt;180. 
2. Monitor Fingersticks at home three times a day ( before each meal ) and record in a note book to bring to PCP appointment 3. 
Return to ED if you experience chest pain , shortness of breath , worsening nausea , extreme sweating , fainting , falling or other concerns DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: Follow up UPEP/SPEP. 
Follow Blood Pressures. 
Follow Fingersticks.
