BNP 46 , CK-MB 0.9 , troponins negative. 
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversions , V3 through V5. Chest x-ray shows enlarged heart with right middle lobe opacity. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Pulmonary: The patient with possible right middle lobe pneumonia versus CHF versus exacerbation versus COPD versus PE. 
The patient is found to have pneumonia. 
She is afebrile with normal white blood cell counts but continues to be hypoxic to the mid 80s on room air. 
Sputum cultures were sent and the patient was treated empirically with Levaquin. 
Levaquin was given for a total of 8 doses in-house and the patient will continue for a total of 14-day course. 
The patient had a PECT , which was initially read was positive , however , the final read was negative for PE. 
The patient initially received a dose of Lovenox 100 mg b.i.d. but was discontinued given negative PE. 
The patient was seen by Pulmonary Service who performed the bronchoscopy on 6/14/05 , which showed a copious blood-tinged mucosa and collapsed right middle lobe lung with narrow orifice. 
Brushings and cytology were taken and sent to Pathology and the results are still pending. 
The patient's pulmonary function test showed severe obstructive disease with the FEV of 0.9 with some aspects of restrictive disease. 
She also underwent a bubble study , which was negative for heart septal defects. 
The PA pressure was estimated at 42. 
The patient then underwent a right heart catheterization to check for vasodilator response and heart function. 
This was performed on 10/10/05 , which showed high right-sided heart pressures and a pulmonary wedge pressure of 16-18 and suggested that the patient was not in acute left heart failure. 
The patient was also seen by the Da , Pulmonary Hypertension Consult Service , whose impressions were that the patient's poor pulmonary function is due to COPD and pectus cavernosum as well as radiation for breast cancer and is chronic condition.

The patient was re-evaluated by physical therapy on 3/29/05 and was found to not need any particular treatments at home. 
The patient was discharged to home with home O2 2-3 nasal cannula and instructed to keep O2 saturations above 88%. 
The patient does work in the hospital. 
The patient's work situation and disability regarding her lung condition was discussed by the attending physician. 
2. Cardiovascular: The patient is stable with no evidence of acute CHF , complicating dyspnea.
