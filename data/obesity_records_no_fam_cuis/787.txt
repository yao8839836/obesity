She has had a variety of important posttransplant medical issues including diabetes , obesity , and spinal stenosis. 
She has also had significant vascular disease including allograft coronary artery disease and bilateral carotid artery disease. 
She underwent stenting of the right internal carotid artery in 9/6 and stenting of the left internal carotid artery in 5/2 In addition , in 9/6 , she underwent stenting of the left circumflex coronary artery and in 2/20 , she underwent stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery. 
At the time of her catheterization in July , it was noted that she had additional disease in the left circumflex and the posterior descending coronary artery and the decision was made to perform an additional procedure for some or all of these lesions. 
The patient now returns for repeat intervention in the left circumflex PCI Notes--- Complicated bifurcation lesion of mLCX involving OM1 and OM2. 
Bifurcation ultimately treated with "coulotte" stenting with 2.5( 28 ) Cypher in lower branch and 2.5( 18 ) Cypher in upper branch. 
Kissing balloon inflations performed at the end of the procedure. 
There was a dissection in the mid portion of the lower OM at the end of the case. 
Likely due to coronary guidewire that had to be placed in a tortous vessel. 
Given distal nature of dissection , we elected not to treat further at this time. 
Patient tolerated procedure well without complaints. 
Started integrilin at the end of the case for 18 hours. 
She should remain on aspirin for life and clopidogrel indefinitely. 
She will have her CK's checked as well as Cr. in AM. SSI coverage. 
Mucomyst and IVF Manual 8Fr sheath removed from Rt CFA. 
7/26 Pt did well overnight. 
groin stable without hematoma , bruit. 
denies any groin/flank pain. 
bp stable. 
ck's flat. 
hct noted to be decreased to 26 from 32- likely related to prlonged procedure. 
will repeat to make ure stable prior to d/c.
