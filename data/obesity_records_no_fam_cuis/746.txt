506204373 | PUO | 74372820 | | 1597827 | 1/24/2006 12:00:00 AM | INFECTED MESH IN ABDOMINAL | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 4/17/2006 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 10/12/2006 ATTENDING: CIVALE , LOVELLA MD PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MRSA-infected abdominal mesh. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 90+-year-old male with a complex past medical history including CAD status post stent x2 , hypertension , CHF with an EF of 10-20% , AF , on chronic anticoagulation , status post pacer placement , and diabetes mellitus who presented to the SICU status post exploratory laparotomy for removal of chronically MRSA-infected mesh from prior abdominal surgery. 
He was admitted to the ICU for careful monitoring and fluid volume management postoperatively. 
He has had multiple abdominal surgeries. 
The mesh was originally placed for ventral hernia repair in 2005. 
He had since developed draining sinus tracts for which cultures have grown out MRSA. 
He was admitted preoperatively for reversal of anticoagulation and semi-urgent removal of the mesh. 
In the operating room , he underwent an exploratory laparotomy , lysis of adhesions and removal of the abdominal mesh. 
He was closed and one Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place. 
During the procedure , he was intubated with etomidate , succinylcholine and kept sedated with Versed and fentanyl. 
He received intraoperative vancomycin and levofloxacin as well as 2200 mL of lactated Ringer's. 
In an attempt to reverse anticoagulation , one unit of FFP was begun but then aborted due to hypotension , which resolved with epinephrine injection , likely due to transfusion reaction. 
Another unit of FFP was hung and tolerated well. 
EBL was 300 mL. 
Urine output was 410 mL for the four-hour case. 
He was extubated uneventfully and transferred to the ICU in stable condition.

ALLERGIES: Ether. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: No alcohol or tobacco use. 
Married , lives with wife , retired 25 years ago. 
ADMISSION LABS: Remarkable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of 30.1% , INR of 1.7. 
EKG V-paced at 60 , no ST-T wave abnormalities compared to preop. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: On admission , temperature 98 , pulse 60 and V-paced , blood pressure 140/85 , saturating 96% on 3 L nasal cannula. 
Neuro: Awake , alert , appropriate. 
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no rales , no wheezes. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Abdomen: Soft , nondistended , mildly tender midline incision with dressing clean , dry and intact. 
JP in midline with sanguinous drainage. 
Lax abdominal wall with protuberance but soft. 
Extremities: Warm and well perfused. 
IMAGING: Chest x-ray negative for acute disease and cardiomegaly. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 90+-year-old gentleman with a complex past medical history including CAD status post MI and stent x2 , CHF was admitted to the SICU , status post ex lap for removal of MRSA-infected mesh for careful monitoring and fluid resuscitation in light of cardiac status. 
His postoperative course was remarkable for bleeding with sanguinous output from the JP drain , a question of an abdominal hematoma and a progressive drop in his hematocrit. 
The heparin drip , which was initiated given the patient's chronic AF , was discontinued and FFP administered. 
Platelets were also given at the request of the Plastic Surgery Team in light of aspirin and Plavix , which were continued due to the patient's cardiac stents. 
Despite bolus Lasix , the patient did develop CHF with symptomatic pulmonary edema and increased oxygen requirement. 
Concomitantly , the patient also became delirious , as is his historical pattern with significant agitation. 
He developed hypertension refractory to beta-blockade , calcium channel blockers and IV ACE inhibitors in this setting. 
The patient was thus placed on a nitroglycerin drip , a furosemide drip with ginger blood product resuscitation to address bleeding and an elevated INR. 
He responded well to this regimen and aggressive pulmonary toilet. 
Both the patient's PCP , Dr. Holihan , and his cardiologist , Dr. Holtmann , did follow the patient. 
His oxygenation never suffered during this time and he did not have significant hypercarbia. 
He was eventually weaned back to nasal cannula. 
He did have a mild transient elevation in creatinine while on the Lasix drip but has since recovered back to baseline off of the Lasix drip. 
His nasogastric tube was removed on 5/18/06 and he tolerated ice chips without difficulty. 
His home cardiac medications were restarted on 6/10/06. 
The patient was out of bed and ambulating without difficulty. 
At the time of dictation , his nitroglycerin drip was being weaned with the assistance of nitro paste. 
He is anticipated to be transferred to the floor once he receives a red blood cell transfusion and once the nitroglycerin drip is off. 
PLAN: Neuro: 1. 
The patient does sundown at home and has done so while in the ICU. 
He has been much more calm and appropriate over the past 24 to 36 hours. 
2. He does experience more significant delirium with morphine and less so with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n. 3. We will continue with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n. , and Zyprexa 2.5 at bedtime p.r.n. per home regimen. 
Haldol is written p.r.n. as needed. 
Cardiovascular: 1. CAD status post stent x2 , AF on chronic anticoagulation , CHF , status post pacer for sick sinus syndrome , currently V paced. 
2. Outpatient systolic blood pressure 150 to 180 , current goal of SBP 140 to 160. 3. Weaning off nitroglycerin drip , nitro paste added. 
4. Diltiazem CD 360 p.o. daily , Lopressor SR 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily , restarted per home regimen. 
5. Aspirin and Plavix to continue for cardiac stents. 
6. Watch for overload. 
Pulmonary: 1. Pulmonary edema with improving chest x-ray , currently saturating well on 4 L of nasal cannula. 
2. Aggressive pulmonary toilet , nebs , out of bed and ambulation. 
3. Lasix with blood. 
GI: 1. Patient advanced to clear liquids only. 
2. All p.o. meds. 
3. Nexium. 
GU: 1. Good urine output off Lasix. 2. Creatinine back to baseline of 1. 3. Lasix to be given with blood as well as potassium. 
4. Slowly trending back to preop weight , would recommend gentle diuresis p.r.n. and careful observance of potassium. 
Heme: 1. Hematocrit 25% today , we will give one unit of packed red blood cells with Lasix and potassium. 
2. Continue with subcutaneous heparin for now and Coumadin to restart at discretion of primary team. 
ID: 1. Vancomycin for MRSA-infected mesh. 
2. PICC line consult ordered for anticipated long-term vancomycin. 
Endocrine: 1. Synthroid at home dose.
