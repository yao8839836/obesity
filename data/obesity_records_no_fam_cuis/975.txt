HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 65-year-old gentleman with history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia who presented to his primary care physician with complaints of exertional chest tightness for the past one to two months that is relieved by rest. 
The patient underwent exercise tolerance testing that elicited 2 mm diffuse ST depression as well as a drop in systolic blood pressure and chest pain after 5 minutes of exercise. 
He was referred for cardiac catheterization , which revealed 80% left main , 80% OM1 , 80% diagonal 1 , and 70% serial LAD lesions as well as an 80% LPLV , and 70% RCA. 
He was referred for surgical revascularization. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy , and hypercholesterolemia. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. 
Father died in her early 50s from multiple medical issues. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: Positive for alcohol use but the patient has not used in recent months. 
ALLERGIES: Sulfa with unknown reaction. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. daily , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily , simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily , and Lantus 50 units subcutaneous nightly. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Height 6 feet 0 inches tall , 68 kilos. 
Vital Signs: Temperature is 97 , heart rate 53 , blood pressure 140/60 in right arm , 132/60 in left arm , and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. 
HEENT: PERRL. 
Oropharynx benign. 
Neck without carotid bruits. 
Chest: Without incisions. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs. 
Respiratory: Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. 
Abdomen: Without incisions , soft , no masses. 
Extremities: Without scarring , varicosities or edema , 2+ pedal and radial pulses bilaterally. 
Allen's test in both upper extremities is normal by pulse oximeter. 
Neuro: Alert and oriented , grossly nonfocal exam. 
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA: Chemistries include sodium of 139 , potassium of 5.0 , BUN of 32 , and creatinine of 1.6. 
Hematology includes white blood cell count of 6 , hematocrit of 36 , and INR of 1.1. 
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 47 with ST elevations in V2 and V3 and biphasic T waves and aVL. 
Chest x-ray is normal. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 8/24/06 and underwent cardiac catheterization with results as previously described. 
He also underwent echocardiogram on 11/8/06 , which estimates ejection fraction at 60% and finds trivial mitral insufficiency , trivial tricuspid insufficiency , and mild left atrial enlargement. 
The patient was taken to the operating room on 10/13/06 where he underwent CABG x5 with LIMA to LAD and a sequential graft of SVG1 connecting the aorta to PDA and then LVB1. 
Left radial artery connects to D1 and then OM1. 
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit following surgery in stable condition. 
He was extubated later on his operative day and was noted to have a slight rise in his MB fraction. 
He was started on dopamine on postoperative day #2 for low blood pressure and low urine output as well as rising creatinine. 
His CK-MB was noted to have peaked and was trending down. 
Postoperative day #3 , the patient was weaned off of dopamine and his creatinine began to trend down. 
On postoperative operative day 4 , the patient was off all drips making good urine and given 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit. 
He was transferred to the Step-Down Unit later that day. 
At time of transfer , he was hemodynamically stable and had been started on diltiazem for spasm prophylaxis of his radial artery graft. 
The plan was to avoid hypotension for renal perfusion and up titrate beta-blockade carefully. 
He was saturating well on room air and his diet was being advanced and was well tolerated. 
His creatinine had fallen at time of transfer to 1.6 from its peak of 2.4 and continued to improve to its baseline levels by time of discharge. 
The patient was followed perioperatively by the Diabetes Management Service for glycemic control. 
He continued to progress daily , remained in sinus rhythm and on room air for the duration of his stay. 
His creatinine remained at baseline level of 1.6. 
He continued to ambulate without problems and was discharged home in good condition on postoperative day #7 on the following medications: Diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. to be continued for three months postoperatively for radial artery graft , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , NovoLog insulin 8 units subcutaneously at 8:00 a.m. , Lantus insulin 40 units subcutaneously at 10:00 p.m. , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. daily , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. pain , Zocor 80 mg p.o. nightly , NovoLog insulin 4 units subcutaneously with lunch and supper. 
The patient is to have follow-up appointments with his cardiologist , Dr. Sasnett , in one to two weeks and with his cardiac surgeon , Dr. Kertesz , in four to six weeks.
