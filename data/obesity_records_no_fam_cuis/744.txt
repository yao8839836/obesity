117775138 | PUO | 35185417 | | 671032 | 5/23/1999 12:00:00 AM | ISCHEMIA RT. LEG | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 9/2/1999 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 8/27/1999 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old gentleman who has a past medical history of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , and peripheral vascular disease who had a revascularization procedure with a left femoral popliteal bypass graft in August of 1998. 
Since that time his foot has become cool and the graft has been noted to be occluded. 
He presents for a re-operation for revascularization. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1991 and series of angioplasties prior to the coronary artery bypass graft. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
Non-healing left foot ulcer with no osteomyelitis. 
Hypertension. 
Peripheral vascular disease. 
MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Glucophage 850 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d. , and NPH 10 units subcu q.p.m. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: In 1991 he had a coronary artery bypass graft. 
His postoperative course was complicated only by atrial fibrillation which was medically managed and he has been without recurrence since that time. 
In August of 1998 he had a left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibial artery bypass graft with non-reversed greater saphenous vein and left common femoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty , as well as debridement of the left lateral foot wound. 
After this surgery , he had an uncomplicated postoperative course. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking in the fall of 1998 and does not use alcohol. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had no chest pain , shortness of breath , or angina since the time of his bypass. 
Just prior to his admission , he was seen by Dr. Lashanda Bachmann of Carna Home Hospital cardiology and was cleared from a cardiac standpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he has done well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms since his bypass surgery. 
Additionally , his preoperative angiogram showed his superficial femoral artery graft to be proximally occluded with mid to distal reconstitution. 
Above the knee popliteal artery , there was mild diffuse disease. 
Below the knee popliteal was patent. 
There was diffuse proximal disease in the peroneal and posterior tibial arteries. 
The posterior tibial occludes above the knee and there is high grade focal stenosis at the anterior tibial origin. 
The dorsalis pedis is patent. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 2/10/99 the patient was brought to the operating room where Dr. Derham performed a left femoral above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft. 
This went without complications. 
The type of graft used as a 6 mm Dalcron graft. 
The immediate postoperative pulse examination was notable for a palpable femoral popliteal and graft pulse with a Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse on left side. 
The patient had an ECG postoperatively that showed no significant change to his preoperative ECG. 
He was started on heparin at 8 p.m. the day of surgery. 
Of note , on postoperative day #1 , the patient got very diaphoretic and nauseous. 
At that time an ECG was done that showed no significant change and , throughout that episode , he had no hemodynamic instability. 
This was likely secondary to having gotten up rather quickly and likely a vasovagal event. 
Throughout the rest of his hospitalization course the patient was mobilized with physical therapy. 
He had a Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse , posterior tibial pulse , and peroneal pulse on left side throughout his entire hospital course. 
However , the graft was no longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was strongly Dopplerable. 
The patient was continued on heparin until his Coumadin reached the high 1 level which was achieved on 1/25/99 when his INR was 1.6. 
At this time his heparin was discontinued. 
The anticoagulation is on for keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or stroke reasons. 
The goal on his INR will be approximately 2 to 2.5. 
On 1/25/99 the patient was stable for discharge. 
His pulse examination was notable for Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse and peroneal pulse. 
The patient's record of Coumadin in response with INR is as follows: On 2/10/99 the patient was started on Coumadin at which point his INR was 1.0. 
On that day he got 5 mg of Coumadin. 
The following day , 5/27/99 , his INR was 1.1 and he got another 5 mg of Coumadin. 
On 8/17/99 the patient's INR was 1.2 and he got another 5 mg of Coumadin. 
On 10/15/99 the patient got 7.5 mg of Coumadin and his INR was 1.2 at that time. 
On 6/8/99 the patient got 10 mg of Coumadin and his INR was 1.6 the following day on the day of discharge , 1/3/99. 
On the day of discharge , 1/25/99 , the patient will get 7.5 mg of Coumadin and his predicted daily dose will be roughly 7.5 mg of Coumadin p.o. q.d. 
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ( this is a critical medicine and he should be on this at all times despite being on Coumadin ) , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , iron 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Glyburide 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , NPH insulin 15 units subcu q.a.m. , CZI insulin sliding scale to get 4 units of regular insulin for blood sugar over 201 to 250 , 6 units of regular insulin for blood sugar of 251 to 300 , 8 units of regular insulin for blood sugar of 301 to 350 , and 10 units for blood sugar 351 to 400 and , greater than 400 , house officer is to be called. 
Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Demerol 50 to 100 mg p.o. q4h p.r.n. pain , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucophage 850 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and Coumadin p.o. q.d. to be dosed according to daily anticoagulation tests as stated previously with INR goal of 2 to 2.5.
