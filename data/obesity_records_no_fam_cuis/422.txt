ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Congestive heart failure. 
The patient has clear evidence of left and right systolic dysfunction.

Right upper quadrant pain may be secondary to congestive heart failure. 
3. History of hypothyroidism. 
Check TSH. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiomyopathy service , Dr. Roxanna Molter , attending , began following patient on the first hospital day. 
It was felt that the Lasix drip was ineffective and recommended starting 200 mg IV Lasix t.i.d. with the goal of keeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. 
The patient had difficulty with repletion of potassium during the entire hospital stay. 
Patient does not tolerate well either the immediate release oral form of potassium or the IV form. 
The IV form hurts the IV site and the oral form makes him nauseous , but he still prefers the oral form. 
Over the course of the admission , 10 mg p.o. twice daily of slow released potassium was started and , eventually , was 30 mg twice daily at the end of his stay. 
Captopril was added to the regimen at 12.5 mg three times a day on the second hospital day and was eventually raised to 50 mg three times a day as his blood pressure tolerated , which took four days. 
Creatinine remained stable throughout admission and did not affect our ability to diurese with Lasix. 
After six days , the patient was adequately diuresed. 
JVP was now not visible. 
Lungs were clear. 
There was no edema. 
The patient is tolerating captopril well. 
Coumadin , which had been 4 mg per day on admission , was cut to 2 mg per day because of the high INR on admission. 
Two days prior to discharge , INR fell to 1.9. 
Patient was restarted on 4 mg per day. 
At discharge , INR was 1.7. 
Patient does not wish to stay to have INR corrected. 
VNA has been arranged to administer Lovenox and to check PT , PTT over the next few days until this normalizes to a therapeutic level. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.d. , Compazine 10 mg p.o. q.6h. 
p.r.n. nausea. 
Patient is being discharged home with VNA services. 
He will follow up with Dr. Rufus Bernas on 11 of May at 9:20 A.M. Dictated By: DENISHA MCRORIE , M.D. BM51 Attending: ROXANNA MOLTER , M.D. WV9  CY373/0273 Batch: 2042 Index No. X6FASQZZM D: 7/14/98 T: 2/10/98 CC: 1. RUFUS C. BERNAS , M.D. WW78
