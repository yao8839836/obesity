302833316 | PUO | 14368263 | | 9443849 | 6/27/2006 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 3/23/2006 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: ATTENDING: STEVINSON , DEE M.D. ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac arrest. 
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Sepsis/line infection , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy , hypertension , diabetes type 2 , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who had a reported cardiac arrest while receiving dialysis on 3/25/06 in her outpatient clinic at Des She began to feel nauseated and then vomited. 
The patient then reportedly went into VFib and was shocked once by EMS , resulting in a narrow QRS complex rhythm. 
She was intubated , received amiodarone and dopamine , as her BP was approximately 70s systolic over palpable diastolic. 
In the ED , a portable chest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral opacities , risk of pulmonary edema and ABG showed respiratory acidosis. 
Pt was transferred to the ICU for further management. 
Of note , she was recently hospitalized at Totin Hospital And Clinic on 7/1/06 through 10/11/07 for initiation of dialysis after her BUN and creatinine had risen remarkably from baseline. 
She was then asymptomatic at that time. 
A fistulogram and angioplasty of her right AV fistula was performed on 7/6/06 with prednisone premedication but it was unsuccessful and therefore a left IJ tunneled dialysis catheter was inserted on 1/18/06 with the tip ending in the right atrium. 
She has since received dialysis treatments with no complication. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , CHF , echo in July of 1999 shows moderate left ventricular hypertrophy of about 65% , diabetes type 2 20 years including with retinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathic pain , hypertension for the past 20 years , hypercholesterolemia , status post medullary CVA July 1999 , right PICA resulting Wallenberg's syndrome , morbid obesity , left knee degenerative joint disease , iron-deficiency anemia. 
ALLERGIES: IV contrast , which gives her anaphylaxis , tetracycline to an unknown reaction , lisinopril. 
HOME MEDICATIONS: At the time of admission include amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. bedtime , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , enalapril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Losartan 50 mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Advair Diskus 250/50 one puff inhaler b.i.d. , insulin NPH 50 units q.a.m. 
subcu and 25 units q.p.m. 
subcu , insulin lispro 18 units subcu at dinner time , Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily , sevelamer 1200 mg p.o. t.i.d. , tramadol 25 mg p.o. q.6 h. 
p.r.n. pain. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: This patient is single and has one son and one grandson. 
Tashia Sobe is the healthcare proxy and is her son. 
She worked 30 years for Sonale Longwood and is currently retired. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Her vital signs were temperature 97.6 , heart rate 72 , BP of 115/66 with mean arterial pressure of 83 , respiratory 14 , sating 100% on 60% inspired FiO2. 
Her CVP at admission was 17 to 20. 
The patient is an obese woman who was intubated and responded to voice. 
Her pupils were 3 to 2 mm bilaterally. 
Her extraocular movements were intact. 
Her chest exam was notable for diffuse crackles throughout with good air movement. 
Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Her abdomen was soft , nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds. 
Extremities showed no edema. 
Distal pulses were not palpable bilaterally. 
She has thickened hyperpigmented skin changes on both feet. 
LABORATORY DATA: Significant labs on admission included a sodium of 141 , potassium 4.1 , chloride of 102 , bicarb of 31 , BUN 33 , creatinine 4.2 with a glucose of 156. 
Her hematocrit was 32. 
An ABG at 10 p.m. of admission on FiO2 of 60% revealed a pH of 7.36 , pCO2 of 52 , pO2 91. 
Her first set of cardiac enzyme revealed a creatinine kinase of 116 and the MB fraction of 0.7 and troponin T of less than assay and lactate of 1.8. 
Tox screen was negative. 
Urinalysis was remarkable for 2+ protein , 3+ blood and positive for nitrates , and negative for leuks , 4 to 10 white blood cells , 15 to 25 red blood cells , 2+ bacteria , 1+ squamous epithelial cells. 
IMAGING: Significant imaging at admission was an x-ray for chest x-ray revealing diffuse bilateral opacities , possible pulmonary edema versus aspiration pneumonia , an EKG showing normal sinus rhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute ST changes and old T-wave inversion in V2. ASSESSMENT: This is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetes who had an apparent VFib arrest at hemodialysis on 7/8/06 and was shocked and admitted to the CCU after being intubated in the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of ED. 
The patient had difficulty weaning from vent and was finally extubated on 11/11/06. 
The CCU course was also complicated by coag-negative Staph grown from a Quinton catheter blood draw. 
The catheter was changed to over a wire on 11/11/06. 
Blood cultures on 10/24/06 revealed likely Staph aureus growth for which the patient received continuous vancomycin. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: 1. Question of VFib arrest. 
Whether or not the patient actually had a VFib arrest seems to be in some doubt as she never had an arrhythmia on tele here by report and her troponin when peaked at 0.14 on 3/25/06 after receiving one external defibrillator shock at hemodialysis. 
We believe what likely happened was a vagal event during hemodialysis , possibly including a pause misread at VF by the defibrillator. 
This explantation is supported by the observation that she has been continuously having nausea with dialysis and her known a history of vasovagal episodes in the past. 
Echo on 3/25/06 shows an EF of 60 to 65% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and no wall motion abnormalities. 
The patient was continued on telemetry and treated with her home dose of beta-blocker with good response. 
2. Volume status. 
The patient is very close to her dry weight upon discharge , which she gives at 354 pounds by wet scale. 
She has been continued on hemodialysis with good results. 
3. Possibly infected hemodialysis catheter. 
The patient had a single set of coag-negative Staph positive blood cultures from Quinton catheter on 11/12/06. 
Line was changed over wire 7/28/06 and was treated with vancomycin dose by renal levels. 
The patient continued to grow out coag-negative Staph , positive blood cultures from 2 out of 2 sets drawn on 8/30/06. 
4. Anemia. 
In the setting of end-stage renal disease her baseline hematocrit is about 30 and stable. 
5. Diabetes type 2. She was treated with a Portland protocol during her ICU course wand was switched to a long and short-acting subcutaneous insulin approaching her home dose of NPH BID. 6. FEN. 
The patient was gradually advanced to an oral diet with no signs of aspiration status post extubation. 
7. Prophylaxis. 
The patient received heparin subcutaneously and Nexium. 
8. Code. 
The patient is full code. 
Her healthcare proxy is her son Tashia Sobe , 633-221-1708. 
DISPOSITION: This patient will likely need rehab and is being screened by PT and OT and will likely be discharged to rehab when bed is available.
