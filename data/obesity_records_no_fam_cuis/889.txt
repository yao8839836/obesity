He has been previously treated at the ONCMC for hypertension. 
He has no cardiac history , no prior history of chest pain. 
He ran out of his blood pressure medicines approximately one week prior to presentation. 
He was feeling well until the day of admission while at work when he noted onset of substernal chest pain while seated. 
He was diaphoretic , nauseated , but had no vomiting. 
He also had some shortness of breath but no palpitations. 
He went to CHH with the same pain and an electrocardiogram showed LVH with strain. 
He was given oxygen and sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. 
He was sent to the I Warho Hospital emergency room. 
There , he was treated with Magnesium Sulfate , IV Lopressor , IV Nitroglycerin , and sublingual Nifedipine. 
His blood pressure at CHH had been 210/150. 
His pain then resolved with a total of approximately five hours. 
He was entirely pain-free since his treatment in the emergency room. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for only hypertension. 
He was on three medications which he is unsure of , including Captopril. 
He apparently had good blood pressure control with his blood pressure medication. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril of unknown dose; Hydrochloro- thiazide 15 mg po q day; Diltiazem of unknown dose. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a middle-aged , black man , in no apparent distress. 
His blood pressure was 140/100 , pulse 76 , afebrile. 
Head and neck exam showed PERRL , oropharynx was benign. 
Neck was supple and no adenopathy. 
Lungs were clear to auscultation. 
His cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , an S4 gallop. 
No murmurs or rubs , no jugular venous distention , and his carotids were 2+ bilaterally. 
Abdomen; good bowel sounds , no hepato- splenomegaly , no masses. 
Extremities; no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
Neurologic exam was non-focal. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION: potassium 4.9 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 134 , hematocrit 44.6 , white count of 11 , and platelets of 223. 
CK was 215. 
PT was 12.1 , PTT 30.1. 
His electrocardiogram showed him to be in normal sinus rhythm at 83 beats per minute , normal intervals , axis was -29. 
He did have LVH with strain. 
His chest x-ray showed no pulmonary vascular redistribution , no effusions or infiltrates. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and ruled in for a myocardial infarction. 
His peak CK was 453 with MB fraction of 16.5. 
He was in the coronary care unit for one day , after which he was transferred to the floor. 
He had no arrhythmias or complications of his myocardial infarction. 
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate concentric LVH with moderate chamber enlargement , posterolateral hypokinesis , and ejection fraction of 45% , and moderate mitral regurgitation with thickened mitral valve leaflets. 
His hypertension was initially controlled with Lopressor 150 mg three times a day. 
He was then changed to Atenolol and Captopril. 
With these medications , he had good blood pressure control. 
One week after his myocardial infarction , he underwent an exercise tolerance test MIBI. 
He went for 9 minutes on his exercise tolerance test and stopped due to completion of his protocol. 
He had no chest pain or shortness of breath and no ischemic changes on his EKG , and reached a peak blood pressure of 180/85 and a peak pulse of 94. His MIBI images showed a fixed defect in the apical anterior lateral wall , but no reversible changes , consistent with myocardial infarction but no ischemia. 
He is discharged to home in stable condition. 
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 100 mg po q day , aspirin 325 mg po q day , Lisinopril 10 mg po q day , sublingual Nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual x3 q 5 minutes p.r.n. chest pain.
