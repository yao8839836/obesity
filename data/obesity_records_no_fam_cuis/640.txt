However she also stated that her chest pain had never really resolved after her cath in 2004. 
Complicating factors include multiple admissions for chest pain , chronic pain syndrome , and narcotic dependence. 
**CV: i: Initially there was concern b/c her CKMB fraction was elevated , and there were T wave inversions in V3-V6 that seemed new in a non-paced EKG that was captured. 
She received one dose of therapeutic lovenox , which was discontinued when she ruled out. 
She continued to complain of chest pain throughout her admission , which typically would be relieved by morphine. 
Suspicion for cardiac chest pain is low , but a MIBI was obtained to determine her baseline. 
The MIBI revealed normal perfusion and normal EF. 
There was abnormal uptake in the left axilla , and obtaining a mammogram was recommended. 
**NEURO: High pain med requirements secondary to chronic pain , and surgical interventions. 
She was maintained on regimen as outlined in last d/c summary , including MS Contin 30mg BID and oxycodone 30mg po q4h prn pain.
