Discharge Date: 9/7/2005 ATTENDING: BARNABA , CARA CHANCE MD SERVICE: Cardiology Team Mahuntjack Por O PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dessie R. Arendz MD , PHD. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure. 
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction; diabetes mellitus; hypertension; hypothyroidism; and anxiety. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is an 82-year-old male with a history of CHF with an EF 10% to 15% who is status post MI , history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and hypothyroidism. 
There is also a question of a history of atrial fibrillation as well. 
In the past 2 months , the patient had complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion with being unable to walk from one end of the room to the other without becoming short of breath; a mild weight gain of 3 pounds as well; and a stable , 2-pillow orthopnea. 
On August , 2005 , the patient awakened from sleep with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pressure associated with nausea and vomiting. 
The patient presented to an outside hospital emergency department where his blood pressure was stable , and he was saturating 94% on room air. 
He was treated with IV Lopressor and nitroglycerin , sublingual and topical. 
He was admitted at that hospital , and Cardiology was consulted who diagnosed him with a mild CHF by his physical examination. 
A chest x-ray was with bibasilar opacities that were more likely atelectasis. 
The patient was ruled out for an MI at that hospital and treated with Lasix at the home doses of Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. with stable systolic blood pressures of 100s to 110s. 
His course at that hospital was complicated by a nonsustained ventricular tachycardia through which he was asymptomatic. 
He was started on Lovenox b.i.d. for a low EF. 
The patient was transferred to the Pagham University Of on May , 2005 , for elective placement of an AICD. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation , anxiety , CHF with an EF of 10% to 15% , MI , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hypothyroidism , status post cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis , and a history of probable prostate ??___??. MEDICATIONS: The patient's home medications had included Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl 10 mEq q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. , Levoxyl 150 mcg q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , trazodone 50 mg to 100 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , and Ativan 0.5 mg p.r.n. 
Transfer medications include digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , levothyroxine 150 mcg q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , KCl 10 mEq p.o. q.d. , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and there is a question whether the patient was currently on Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously b.i.d. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an ex-smoker and quit smoking greater than 20 years ago. 
He lives with his wife. 
FAMILY HSITORY: Both the parents of the patient are with a CAD in their 70s. 
PHYSICAL EXAMIANTION: The patient's vital signs upon arriving on the floor; temperature was 94.5 , pulse was 64 , blood pressure was 120/60 , respirations were 20 , and he was saturating 98% on room air. 
Examination was remarkable for JVP at his jaw and moist mucous membranes. 
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with frequent ectopy and S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4. 
The lungs were with a faint left bibasilar crackles. 
Abdomen was benign. 
The extremities were with no pitting edema but slightly cool bilaterally. 
Neurological examination is nonfocal. 
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 0.9. 
CBC was unremarkable. 
BNP was 2035. 
INR was 1.3 , and PTT was 37.4. 
Of note , an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital on July , 2005 , showed an EF of 10% to 15% , moderate left atrial enlargement , right atrial enlargement , mild to moderate aortic regurgitation , mild MR and mild TR , and pulmonary artery pressures of 45. 
An ETT myoview performed at the outside hospital showed a large fixed defect inferiorly and inferolaterally as well as a mild ischemia in the lateral wall. 
EKG at the outside hospital performed on July , 2005 , was with sinus rhythm; right bundle-branch block with T wave inversion in V1 through V4; Q waves in II , III , and aVF; first-degree AV block; and a question of a left anterior fascicular block. 
A chest x-ray at the outside hospital on August , 2005 , was with bibasilar opacities with a question of atelectasis versus pneumonia. 
Admission EKG here on May , 2005 , was unchanged from the outside hospital. 
Admission chest x-ray on done on May , 2005 , showed cardiomegaly and mild bilateral costophrenic angle blunting. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Subjectively , this is an 82-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10% to 15% status post myocardial infarction , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and hypothyroidism who was transferred to the Pagham University Of for an elective automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. 
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. 
The patient had no active ischemia. 
He does have a history of a myocardial infarction , which was inferior in area. 
His ETT-MIBI was with mild lateral wall ischemia with a large fixed inferior and inferolateral defect. 
The patient was continued on aspirin , ACE inhibitor , and statin and restarted on his beta-blocker. 
A catheterization was performed on May , 2005 , which demonstrated a left dominant system and no significant left main or left anterior descending artery lesions. 
A left posterior descending artery had an 80% lesion in the mid posterior descending artery. 
Ejection fraction was estimated at 15% with global hypokinesis and dilated left atrium and dilated left ventricle. 
The patient had elevated wedge pressure of 42 and 2+ mitral regurgitation. 
2. Pump: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
On admission , he was volume overloaded with a BNP of 2035. 
On admission , the patient was treated with Lasix , Isordil , ACE inhibitor , and digoxin. 
Hydralazine was added. 
A catheterization on May , 2005 , demonstrated elevated left heart-filling pressures. 
The patient was diuresed subsequently with more than 4 liters and was euvolemic upon discharge. 
The patient is currently euvolemic on p.o. Lasix to being slightly dry. 
Given increased CO2 but a normal BUN and creatinine , we have changed the patient's Lasix dose to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40 mg p.o. q.p.m. 
upon discharge. 
Given the systolic blood pressures in the 90s and 100s , the patient's lisinopril was changed to 20 mg p.o. q.d. 
The patient is to be followed by VNA at home to monitor blood pressure. 
3. Rhythm: The patient was followed by EP. His admission electrocardiogram showed a right bundle-branch block with a question of left anterior fascicular block and a first-degree arteriovenous block. 
On October , 2005 , the patient became suddenly bradycardic to the 30s and 40s with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia x30 beats and a new second-degree arteriovenous block type 1. 
The patient was asymptomatic throughout this. 
Zoll pads were placed , and atropine was put at the bedside. 
On August , 2005 , the patient appeared to be back in normal sinus rhythm. 
On August , 2005 , a pacemaker with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed with cardiac resynchronization therapy as well. 
This was interrogated on June , 2005 , and the ??___?? were confined. 
The patient will follow up with Dr. Schoeppner in EP on July , 2005 , at 10:20 a.m. 
The patient is to avoid vigorous activity. 
4. Endocrine: The patient is with diabetes mellitus and was covered with regular insulin sliding scale here. 
He was advised to restart on his home dose of glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. upon discharge. 
The patients' history of hypothyroidism and thyroid function test is consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome. 
He was continued on levothyroxine at his home dose. 5. Psychiatry: The patient is given trazodone and Ativan q.h.s. p.r.n. 
The patient's mental status was somewhat decreased on the night of August , 2005 , status post automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. 
He was not oriented to time. 
This later resolved by the evening of September , 2005. 
6. Genitourinary: The patient was noted to have bloody urine after receiving heparin during the catheterization thought secondary to Foley trauma. 
There were no clots; however , given significant hematuria , ??___?? Foley was placed and bladder irrigation was started. 
Urinalysis was negative. 
Urine was pink colored by the night of September , 2005. 
The Foley was discontinued due to a leakage. 
This was not replaced given good urine output , continued pink-colored urine , and no clots. 
The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout this. 
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was given pneumoboots given the new automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and hematuria. 
8. Infectious Disease: The patient is to be on clindamycin for 7 days status post pacemaker placement.
