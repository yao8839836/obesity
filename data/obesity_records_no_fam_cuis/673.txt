Pt states that he has not increased his Na intake recently. 
Pt repeatedly denied SOB , increased abd girth , and PND. 
Pt did note that he sleeps on 2 pillows at night but his breathing his fine when he is lying flat. 
Next day spoke with patient's wife who confirmed story documented by PCP including increasing shorntness of breath and orthopnea.

----- PLAN: CARDS: I: No known h/o CAD-little concern for ACS with no sxs except LE edema -unclear why not on ASA , no h/o GI bleed or ulcer. 
Will start ASA for primary/secondary prevention. 
Checked lipid profile , trigs very elevated at 482 and HDL 24. 
LDL could not be peformed b/c trigs were so high. 
Started gemfibrozil , pt can have repeat lipid profile as outpt and statin at discretion of PCP. 
Pt was continued on BB but dose was decreased to 50mg po daily as pt having asymptomatic bradycardia to 40's while sleeping. 
P: Pt's MMC notes list CHF as dx , pt denies any h/o LE edema or CHF before 2 weeks ago but is on lasix bid at home. 
Last echo in 4/3 showed LVH w/ preserved EF. Pt with likely diastolic dysfunction. 
Pt on exam has only LE edema , but received 120 IV lasix in ED. Pt's presentation c/w CHF exacerbation but BNP of 13 is unusual. 
Continued to diurese pt with IV lasix and once he was approaching euvolemia switched him back over to home dose. 
Pt's LE edema likely multifactorial due to CHF and some component of chronic venous stasis. 
LENIs were checked and were negative for DVTS. 
Discontinued pt's CCB as may be contributing to LE edema. 
Echo was repeated this admit which showed EF 60-65% and signs of diastolic dysfunction. 
HTN: BP was controlled this admit. 
Pt was continued on BB , norvasc , &amp; catapres R: no issues this admit ENDO: Pt has h/o DM and pt states he is taking insulin at home ( unclear dose ). 
Pt was started on Lantus with SS novolog and his sugars were somewhat elevated. 
Advised pt to restart home insulin regimen after d/c. 
Sent HgA1C but was still pending at the time of discharge. 
RENAL: pt appears to have CKD per MMC recs -baseline 1.4-1.6 , renally dose meds NEURO: Pt's wife noted that pt has intermittently been confused at home. 
She describes episodes when he wakes up at night and doesn't know where he is. 
This is likely due to hypoxia as pt has severe sleep apnea and rarely wears cpap at home. 
Pt was alert and oriented during this admit. 
Sent labs to evaluate for secondary cause of dementia and they were negative. 
Suggested that pt f/u with PCP if these episodes persist. 
PULM: Pt with h/o sleep apnea. 
Per 2003 sleep study pt's sleep apnea was central and not obstructive although this is difficult to believe based on pt's body habitus and redundant neck tissue. 
Pt evaluated by pulmonary after RA ABG showed PaO2 50's. 
Pt pulse ox was monitored and when he fell asleep without his cpap he desatted to low 60's and high 50's. 
Pt satted in mid 90's on RA while awake and upright. 
Pulmonary thought pt likely with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea ( central +/- obstructive ). 
Pt tried on empiric bipap ( 4/9 ) the night prior to d/c and felt that he slept much better. 
Of note pt used the nasal mask in house but has the full mask at home. 
Tried to set up pt for home bipap but is not eligible unless has another sleep study. 
Communicated this with pt's PCP who will set up repeat sleep study in near future. 
Pt also started on empiric qhs acetazolamide per pulmonary recs based on recent data showing that it improves symptoms in pt's with central sleep apnea and heart failure.
