ISCHEMIA | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 7/7/2005 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 6/26/2005 ATTENDING: KATCSMORAK , CARRI MD ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Chest pain/SOB. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , this is an 85-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation , CRI , and prior mitral valve replacement , and bioprosthesis presented with DE compensated heart failure , increasing shortness of breath , and chest pain. 
He has complex cardiovascular history and progressive symptoms of heart failure. 
He had CABG in 1980 and 1990 and multiple PCI most recently in 6/29 with intervention on SVG to the PDA. 
He had MVR in 1980 with bioprosthesis. 
He had implantation of a CRT pacemaker with ICV function in 3/7 His history of heart failure dates back ten years , but he has had more marked decline over the past two years currently has SOB typically , does not have orthopnea , PND , or leg edema. 
He has been admitted to the Osri Medical Center several times for management of CHF in 1/14 After diuresis he states he could walk up to 30 yards on a flat surface , but could not walk up steps. 
He was at baseline until 3/29/05 when he had recurrent episodes of chest pain respondive to sublingual nitroglycerin associated with diaphoresis , nausea , palpitations , and lightheadedness. 
On 10/17/05 , he had acute onset of shortness of breath at rest after eating. 
He was admitted to the Osri Medical Center and treated with diuresis and anticoagulation. 
MI was excluded by serial enzymes. 
He was noted to be anemic. 
Other lab values were consistent with hemolysis. 
As a part of his workup , during ETT MIBI , he was able to walk 2 minutes 52 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol , peak HR 94 , echo showed a dilated LV , EF of 34% , mild global hypokinesis , and septal and apical akinesis , enlarged dixed defect in the inferior apical wall with moderate fixed defect in the inferior apical segment , and a small amount of reversibility was noted in a mild inferior lateral defect. 
Echocardiogram at PUO on 5/13 showed EF of 35% , septal and apical akinesis , with normal RV function , mitral bioprosthesis , mildly elevated antegrade velocities , mild perivalvular regurgitation , moderate TR , moderate pulmonary hypertension , SVP of 48 mmHg and PA plus RA pressure , transferred for evaluation and management of chest pain at Osri Medical Center with ? 
need for catheterization. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CHF , EF is 25% , atrial fibrillation , chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 , mild COPD , status post AAA repair in 1995 , BPH , TIA/CVA , anemia , on home O2 , status post AICD , pacer , status post sinus arrest in 1993 , ischemic cardiomyopathy , CAD , status post mitral valve replacement , porcine valve placed in 1980 , and status post CABG x2. Please see HPI for further information. 
MEDICATIONS: At home , Flomax 0.4 , Proscar 5 mg daily , Lipitor 80 mg daily , Toprol 50 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg daily , and Imdur 90 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin , Advair , and Combivent. 
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: As above plus Lasix increased to 80 mg b.i.d. , and Imdur to 120 daily. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: Married and lives with wife. 
Family very involved. 
A former smoker , quit in 1980. 
He is retired supervisor in water department. 
Family history is otherwise noncontributory. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: NAD , 60s to 70s , afebrile , and BP is 100 to 110 over 50 to 60. Saturating at 89% on two liters , 94% on four liters , JVD 12 , mild HJR , bronchial breath sounds , dullness at bases , and no rales. 
Cardiac is irregularly regular 2/6 mid peaking SVM , and 2/6 HSM at apex. 
Abdomen: Benign. 
No HSM. 
Extremities are warm without edema. 
LABORATORY DATA: EKG underlying atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing at 70. Labs of note , hematocrit 27 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.8 , sodium 140 , BNP brain natriuretic peptide 482 , CK 61 , troponin 0.1 , haptoglobin less than assay , reticulocyte count 6.2 , and LDH 679. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Cardiovascular: An 84-year-old man with complex medical issues elderly and debilitated currently with last three to four heart failures secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
He has undergone multiples attempts of revascularization including CABG x2 , repeated PCI , most recently in 6/29 with intervention on SVG. 
Revascularization options at this point are quite limited , the amount of active ischemic burden suggested by his recent submaximal MIBI ETT is unlikely to account for the severity of the symptoms that he is experiencing. 
Unfortunately , his overall debilitated state makes surgical intervention unlikely to be tolerated. 
He was moderately overloaded at the time of arrival and was aggressively diuresed. 
An echocardiogram was performed on 7/24/05 , which showed moderate known perivalvular mitral valve leakage and an EF of 30%. 
A right heart catheterization was performed on 8/23/05 which showed RA pressure 7/7 , mean 5; RV 52/1 , mean 4; PA 54/17 , mean 34; and PW 21/40 , mean 23. 
In summary , overall dry after aggressive diuresis; however , with large amounts of mitral regurgitation. 
For this reason , it was discussed with the family possible clamping for his mitral valve as he is not a candidate for mitral valve replacement given his end-stage heart and generally frail state. 
Plan as of the time of this dictation is to undergo TEE on 2/18/05 to evaluate whether clamping of the mitral valve would be possible and then to have mitral valve clamping later this week. 
The patient was diuresed effectively with Lasix 200 mg IV b.i.d. with metolazone. 
The patient was also started on digoxin and Aldactone. 
He had a bump in his creatinine to 2.2 on 10/3/05 and then it continued to rise and for this reason diuresis was held as of 2/10/05. 
As for rhythm , paced , normal sinus rhythm , on telemetry. 
O 2/6/05 brief round of V-tach , paced out of it. 
An AICD and pacer in place. 
Pulmonary: COPD. 
On O2 at home , however , with increased desaturation here in the hospital to mid 80s while walking , thought secondary to his extreme mitral valve regurgitation. 
On Advair , Combivent , and albuterol nebulizer. 
Renal: Elevated creatinine in mid 2s , baseline CRI creatinine 1.5 , and all medications were renally dosed. 
FEN: Potassium and Magnesium scales , b.i.d electrolytes given diuresis. 
Heme: Hemolytic anemia with bilirubin of 3.0 likely secondary to mitral valve regurgitation , not surgical candidate , baseline unknown. 
Given transfusion on 2/7/05. 
Transfuse for hematocrit less than 30. 
PTT goal of 60 to 80 on heparin. 
He will eventually be put on Coumadin. 
CODE: Code status was changed during the time of this admission to DNR/DNI/no pressors. 
This is an interval dictation , please see addendum for remaining hospital course and for discharge medications.
