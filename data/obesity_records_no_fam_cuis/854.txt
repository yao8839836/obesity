Pt reports eating breakfast and taking morning medications and then feeling lightheaded , diaphoretic , with his heart racing. 
His symptoms began while he was sitting , but he stood up to walk across the room and felt his symptoms worsen. 
He remembers feeling more "dizzy" and "unsteady" and then remembers being on the ground. 
He does not remember falling or lowering himself , but he denies loss of consciousness. 
EMS was called to take him to the ED. On the ambulance he felt some substernal heaviness and discomfort that lasted less than 1 hours. 
The feeling resolved after receiving oxygen. 
He denies chest pain prior to fainting. 
He has not felt well since his renal transplant complaining of shortness of breath. 
He however notes increasing shortness of breath , cough , and fatigue over the past weeks. 
Denies fever , chills , edema , melena , bright red blood per rectum , hematochezia , dysuria , hematuria. 
He did feel nauseas after he fainted. 
In ED seen by renal fellow and sent to dialysis where he received 2 units PRBC for Hct of 24.

WBC 12.48 , HCT 24.01.2 , PTT 41.1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Studies: CXR 11.15.2006 
Stable mild pulmonary edema ( unofficial ). 
EKG sinus rhythm nonspecific twave abnormalities in I , II , avf , avl , twi in v5 and v6 unchanged from prior in September 2006. 
Echo 11/3 valves and EF OK ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Consults: GI Rader , Yael 74610 , Renal is primary team. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Impression: 58M with ESRD s/p renal allograft rejection here for syncope , likely symptomatic anemia. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Plan: Renal - by history sounds volume overloaded will likely need more frequent dialysis to remove excess fluid. 
Nephrocaps. 
On steroid taper for rejection. 
CV-I: nonobstructive CAD s/p LIMA to LAD , pt has been on ASA in past , unclear why stopped will consider adding asa after consultation with PCP. 
Will ROMI with enzymes as pt admitted for sycope.given 
NSVT may need ischemic eval. 
CV-P: volume up by symptoms and xray , will need more frequent dialysis , will consider repeating echo as part of the evalution for syncope - specifically to evaluate aortic prosthesis function. 
Echo OK. CV-R: monitor on tele , BB for VT Heme: Pt anemia with Hct of 24 , on high doses of Epo and IV iron at HD , this suggests blood loss. 
Will guiaic stools , monitor hct , renal ultrasound today to evaluate for hemorrhage into allograft. 
Received 2 units PRBC at HD.GI consulted and planning EGD on Monday. 
Pulm: chronic cough likely secondary to cigarette smoking , recent worsening likely represents pulmonary edema , will monitor respiratory status. 
ID: WBC 12 , with no evidence of infection , monitor fever curve and culture if spikes. 
Endo: DM on vague sliding scale at home , Will start with NPH 10 BID , Regular 4 AC with sliding scale for additional coverage and titrate to requirements. 
GI: guiac + stools. 
EGD uremarkable here. 
Nexium for gerd. 
GU: cystoscopy as outpt , urine cytology , for intermittent hematuria. 
PPX: Nexium , Hep SC TID.
