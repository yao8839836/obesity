HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Zazueta is a 54-year-old female who was found to have an abnormal EKG during a preoperative evaluation for partial thyroidectomy , which prompted a cardiac workup. 
Stress test revealed ischemic changes and followup cardiac catheterization revealed mid right coronary artery stenosis of 70% , proximal right coronary artery with 80% and the left anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal 60% stenosis , left main coronary artery with a mid 70% stenosis , left circumflex coronary artery with a proximal 80% stenosis and a mid 50% stenosis and a right dominant circulation. 
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55% with trivial mitral insufficiency and trivial tricuspid insufficiency. 
Carotid noninvasives revealed that the left internal carotid artery could not be assessed due to the patient's body habitus and large goiter , but did reveal relatively diminished diastolic flow in the right common carotid artery with a velocity 69 cm per second proximally and 62 cm per second mid , 53 cm per second distally. 
Velocities in the left common carotid artery 92 cm per second approximately , 62 cm per second mid , and 73 cm per second distally. 
CT angiogram of the neck on 10/10/06 revealed the following: 1. High-grade stenosis or possible complete occlusion of the right cervical ICA at origin , the possibility of a very small caliber residual voluminous suggested catheterization. 
Angiography is recommended for further assessment. 
2. Very high-grade narrowing of the left proximal ICA at its origin by complex calcified and likely ulcerative plaque. 
3. Internal carotid artery cavernous segment stenosis on the left is likely mild-to-moderate. 
4. Mild proximal basilar artery stenosis. 
5. Vertebral artery origin stenosis cannot be excluded. 
They are not well evaluated due to beam hardening related to body habitus. 
6. 
Large neurogenous thyroid lesions are most suggestive of goiter , although more aggressive lesions cannot be completely excluded. 
Clinical correlation and thyroid ultrasound could be performed for further evaluation if indicated. 
7. Cervical spine degenerative disease and stenosis in the lower C-spine. 
The patient underwent repeat CT of the head and neck. 
Final report is not available at this time. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for class III heart failure with marked limitation of physical activity , hypothyroidism , dyslipidemia , status post brain tumor in 1973; pathology unknown , remote seizure disorder , migraines , goiter status post left partial thyroidectomy preoperative for a right thyroidectomy after her coronary artery bypass grafting. 
She is status post a partial oophorectomy and as stated above craniotomy for tumor resection in 1973 and status post left partial thyroidectomy and right breast biopsy. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to penicillin where she develops hives. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 100 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , simvastatin 40 mg daily , vitamin C one tab daily , woman's wellness natural hormone balance two tablets a day and Pepcid-AC one tab as needed.

Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or heaves. 
Peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally in the carotid , radial , femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses. 
Respiratory , breath sounds clear bilaterally , is otherwise noncontributory. 
ADMISSION LABS: Sodium 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride of 103 , CO2 29 , BUN of 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 205 , magnesium 1.9 , and BNP is 62 , WBC 7.51 , hematocrit 38.4 , hemoglobin 12.4 , platelets of 312 , PT 14.9 , PT/INR of 1.2 , and PTT of 26.3. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent left carotid artery stent placement on 4/18/06. 
Coronary artery bypass grafting was canceled due to the high-grade carotid stenosis. 
Operative report is not available at this time. 
Postoperatively , the patient had developed diplopia and a distant visual disturbance. 
CT of the head was negative for any acute event. 
Neurologically , the patient's mental status was intact , alert , oriented. 
The patient's neurologic symptoms improved and she was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on 7/6/2006 and was cleared for discharge to home on 11/27/06. 
Mrs. Zazueta will follow up with the vascular surgeon , Dr. Youngberg , in two weeks and Dr. Stukowski will perform her coronary artery bypass graft in four weeks. 
She is discharged to home in stable condition. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Plavix 75 mg , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg a day , Motrin 400-800 mg q.6 h. 
p.r.n. pain , Toprol-XL 100 mg daily , simvastatin 40 mg nightly. 
DISCHARGE LABS: Glucose 101 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1 , sodium 139 , potassium 4.4 , chloride of 102 , CO2 28 , magnesium 1.9 , WBC is 7.07 , hemoglobin 11 , hematocrit 33.3 , platelets of 274. 
DISPOSITION: Ms. Zazueta will be discharged to home in stable condition , will follow up with Dr. Janay Stukowski for her coronary artery bypass grafting next month and Dr. Youngberg as stated above in two weeks for her postoperative left carotid artery stent placement.
