He was discharged yesterday and now presents with fevers , chills , shaking , and increasing abdominal distention. 
On admission also , noted to have increased sputum production and therefore question aspiration event was considered while at rehab. 
At his recent hospital stay , he was evaluated for PFO , which was found to be negative , had no paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , had hypertensive episodes to systolic blood pressure of 240 , which responded well to hydralazine. 
Had a troponin leak to peak of 1.94 , which trended down and was considered to be demand related. 
At baseline , the patient lives with his wife at home , walks with a walker , and requires assistance with ADLs. 
On arrival on the floor , the patient had a temperature of 101.3 , axillary , heart rate 80s to 90s , blood pressure 180s/80s , and O2 saturation of 97% on three liters. 
His abdomen was found to be quite distended , however not rigid and had no peritoneal signs. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. 
Right hip fracture status post right hemiarthroplasty. 
2. Non insulin-dependent diabetes. 
3. Depression. 4. Psoriasis. 5. Leiomyoma. 
6. Hypertension. 
7. SVT. 8. History of GI bleed. 
9. Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.6. 
10. 
Embolic stroke in October of 2006. 
IMPORTANT STUDIES: 1. Chest PA and lateral dated 1/10/06 , increased opacification seen on the lateral view over the lung base concerning for pneumonia , which is probably in the left lower lobe , atelectasis was seen in the right lung , tiny bilateral pleural effusions are possible , and heart size is normal. 
2. Abdominal ultrasound on 3/1/06 : 1 ) Contracted gallbladder with gallstones. 
No sonographic evidence for acute cholecystitis. 2 ) Bilateral pleural effusions. 
3. KUB dated 4/5/06 , no subdiaphragmatic air is seen , no high-grade obstruction , and limited study due to motion artifact. 
4. Urine culture on 4/5/06 , greater than 100 , 000 pansensitive E. coli. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. 
The patient was found to have a pansensitive E. coli UTI and a questionable left lower lobe pneumonia , which would have likely been due to aspiration given the patient's recent stroke and documented aspiration by Speech and Swallow on previous admission. 
The patient's white count , which was initially 19.8 on the day of admission trended down over the first three days of his admission as he was treated with Levaquin. 
The Levaquin , which will cover both the urinary tract infection and the possibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a total of a 14-day course to end on 11/16/06. 
The patient's blood cultures showed no growth. 
2. GU , the patient was found to have 1.5 mL of urine in his bladder when he was admitted indicating significant urinary retention. 
A Foley was placed and the patient drained the urine. 
The patient was started on Flomax to improve his recovery from the urethral obstruction. 
Most likely , the patient has underlying urinary retention that was exacerbated by his recent Foley placement during his previous admission. 
Then when he went to rehab without the Foley ( note he did void several times prior to discharge from the hospital ). 
The patient developed urinary obstruction likely contributing to his urinary tract infection and requiring readmission. 
The Foley was kept in place until hospital day four. 
When the Foley was taken out , the patient did not void at all. 
A bladder scan ten hours after the Foley was taken out revealed 432 mL of urine in his bladder. 
A Foley was replaced in his bladder and Urology was consulted. 
Urology recommended bladder rest for seven days meaning that the Foley should be left in place for seven days and then he is to follow up with Dr. Haley Tonsil with the Foley still in place for a voiding trial within a week after discharge. 
3. Renal , the patient's creatinine at admission was 2.2 , which is significantly above his baseline. 
This was attributed to acute renal failure secondary to the urinary obstruction. 
When the Foley was placed , his creatinine steadily declined , and on the day prior to discharge was 1.2 , which is within his normal range. 
4. Cardiovascular , the patient continued to be hypertensive with SBPs greater than 200 , particularly at night. 
Therefore , during his hospital course , his blood pressure regimen was titrated up such that at the time of discharge , his blood pressure regimen is Lopressor 50 q.i.d. and Norvasc 10 daily. 
Blood pressures during 24 hours prior to discharge ranged from 110 to 140/70s and his heart rate ranged 64 to 82. 5. Endocrine , the patient was treated with insulin and his p.o. regimen while inhouse and this can be continued at rehab. 
He will be discharged on Lantus 12 , NovoLog sliding scale , and tolbutamide 500 daily. 
6. GI , the patient had a steadily rising alk phos through the course of his hospital stay. 
At admission , it was 206 and it rose to 508. 
A GGT was drawn and found to also be elevated at 119 , therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed , which showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but no acute cholecystitis. 
The patient was found to be constipated on the day prior to discharge and was given a Dulcolax suppository , which had worked in the past. 
7. Prophylaxis , the patient received Lovenox subcu daily. 
CODE STATUS: The patient is DNI though he would want to be resuscitated with CPR , defibrillated , and given pressors. 
CONTACT INFORMATION: His son , Dr. Kamala Litteer , can be contacted at 559-049-8783 or 759-360-1703. 
His wife can be contacted at 011-647-5438.
