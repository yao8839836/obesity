2. REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE. 
3. HYPERTENSION. 
4. MORBID OBESITY. 
BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 60-year-old African-American female with a recent , eleven-day hospitalization at the Pagham University Of for a congestive heart failure flare. 
The patient presents now with two days of progressively worsening shortness of breath at rehabilitation. 
The patient presented initially with chest pain and CHF , and was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , in early October . 
An echocardiogram then revealed mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction and abnormal septal motion , with septal apical hypokinesis and minimal mitral regurgitation. 
An exercise treadmill test at that time was without ischemia , though her target heart rate was not achieved. 
During the hospitalization at that time , the patient was slowly diuresed and then discharged to rehabilitation. 
At rehabilitation , she has been chest-pain-free , but she has had increasing shortness of breath and wheezing. 
In the emergency department , she was found to be in congestive heart failure by chest x-ray. 
The oxygen saturations were 93% on 2 liters. 
She was given albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and IV Solu-Medrol , and was also given a dose of 120 mg of IV Lasix. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see the Problem List. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient has had the following surgeries: ( 1 ) A cholecystectomy; ( 2 ) Two Caesarean sections. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Ventolin two puffs p.o. q.i.d. , Azmacort four puffs b.i.d. , Rhinocort two puffs b.i.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Cozaar 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. , and nitroglycerin sublingually p.r.n. 
LISTED ALLERGIES: Lisinopril gives her a cough. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use and no IV drug abuse. 
The patient works in the Ro Birm Xingchenaheights at the Pagham University Of . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the vital signs include the following: the temperature is 98.0 degrees F. , the pulse 87 , the blood pressure 180/110 , and the respirations 24. 
The oxygen saturation is 92% on 2 liters. 
In general , the patient is a morbidly obese female in mild to moderate distress. 
The neck is supple , without bruits; the jugular venous pressure cannot be assessed secondary to the patient's body habitus. 
The cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with an S1 , an S2 , and an S3 , and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border and a 2/6 murmur at the left upper sternal border. 
Examination of the lungs is significant for rales bilaterally in one-third of the lung fields. 
She also has inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. 
The abdomen is soft , non-tender , and non-distended , with no masses. 
The extremities show 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities and the pulses are 2+ in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. 
On neurological examination , the patient is alert and oriented times four. 
The neurologic examination is otherwise non-focal. 
DATA BASE: The admission chest x-ray showed moderate congestive heart failure with moderate pulmonary edema but no acute infiltrate. 
The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 60 , a normal axis , and no ST-T wave changes when compared to prior EKGs from October 2000. 
The admission laboratory studies were as follows. 
The sodium was 140 , the potassium 4.0 , the chloride 99 , the CO2 39 , the BUN 23 , the creatinine 0.9 , the glucose 78 , the CK 114 , the troponin 0.00. 
The white count was 8 , 200 , the hematocrit 44 , and the platelets 315 , 000. 
The PT was 11.8 , the PTT 23.1. 
The cholesterol level was 206. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems: 1. CARDIOVASCULAR. 
The patient was re-admitted to the Pagham University Of with worsening congestive heart failure on a dose of Lasix of 40 mg p.o. q.d. 
She received 120 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department and her diuresis was continued with aggressive intravenous Lasix until two days prior to discharge , when she was switched to p.o. Lasix. 
She was started initially on 120 mg of IV Lasix once a day , which resulted in a diuresis of 1-2 liters every twenty-four-hour period. 
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes and EKGs. 
The decision had been made during the last hospitalization to manage her coronary artery disease medically. 
The patient did not desire cardiac catheterization at this point. 
She was eventually switched to oral Lasix at a dose of 60 mg by mouth twice a day. 
2. RESPIRATORY. 
The patient was admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure but also had evidence of reactive airway disease on clinical examination. 
She had profound inspiratory and expiratory wheezes and shortness of breath. 
Due to the history of reactive airway disease , the patient was started on intravenous Solu-Medrol , albuterol , Atrovent , and Serevent. 
She was given supplemental O2 to maintain her oxygen saturations greater than 93%. 
She was continued on her IV steroids throughout the hospitalization , and these were eventually switched to p.o. prednisone near the end of the hospitalization and were to be tapered on an outpatient basis. 
Her shortness of breath resolved by the time of discharge. 
3. FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES. 
Due to the aggressive diuresis , the patient developed a contraction alkalosis during the course of hospitalization. 
Her bicarbonate rose to a level of 43 , with a BUN of 34. 
At this time , the diuresis was withdrawn slightly and the patient's electrolytes normalized.
