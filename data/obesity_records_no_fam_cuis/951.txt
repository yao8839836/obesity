OTHER DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , DIABETES MELLITUS AND STATUS POST CVA. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT: 66 year-old male complaining of shortness of breath times six months. 
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: At baseline the patient exerts himself without significant chest pain or pressure. 
Last February he recalls the onset of shortness of breath gradually over several months time. 
Maximal exertion has been limited by walking utilization at one-quarter mile with significant symptoms fatigue. 
The development of severe shortness of breath occurred most rapidly eight days prior to admission when he experienced air starvation while getting into a car associated with significant difficulty with speech and slurring times two minutes. 
There was no muscle weakness , visual change , loss of consciousness , palpitation , but the patient did feel as if he was about to lose consciousness. 
Mr. Maleszka also denied labored breathing , though his breathing was noted to be shallow and improved immediately thereafter. 
There was cough associated with post nasal drip but not hemoptysis. 
He admitted to left sided chest pain lasting 30 seconds which was believed not to be cardiac by his outpatient cardiologist , Dr. Nanci Gort On 10/20 he was admitted to Tionmark Hospital for two days where echocardiogram was performed as well as a chest x-ray and he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
A VQ scan was then arranged for 5/20 at which time he also had a Dobutamine Sestamibi scan. 
The test were not available at the time of his admission the I Warho Hospital on 11/9 At the time of his admission he denied any shortness of breath though admitted to shortness of breath with minimal exertion. 
MEDICATION: NPH Insulin , Regular INsulin , Glucophage and Aspirin. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease. 
No history of myocardial infarction. 
( 2 ) Status post coronary artery bypass graft October , 1995 after acceleration of anginal chest pain. 
Catheterization at that time had revealed 60% proximal left anterior descending lesion , totally occluded circ and 50% ramus with an right coronary artery mid-85% stenosis. 
Left ventricular ejection fraction was 61% at that time. 
Coronary artery bypass graft in 1995 was LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA , SVG to Ramus , SVG to OM. Sestamibi scan performed in July of hte year 2000 demonstrated 5 out of 20 segments of mild inferior ischemia with increased right ventricular uptake. 
( 3 ) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus diagnosed in 1980. 
( 4 ) Cerebrovascular accident 1997 with residual right lower extremity motor debilitation and word finding. 
( 5 ) P32 , Calcium 45 , Carbon 14 exposure at work. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a microbiologist at Eepidssun No Sterrock , works on virus in Lan Ma Mer harbor and lives in Worth He has a tobacco history significant for 35 pack years of pipe and cigarette smoking. 
He has no significant alcohol history. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.2 , Heart rate 66 , Blood pressure 144/84 , 96% O2 sat on room air. 
NECK: JVP was at 8 cm , carotids 2+ bilaterally without bruit and no lymphadenopathy. 
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with a loud P2 at the left upper sternal border and S4. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. 
ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender , nondistended with normal abdominal bowel sounds and a palpable liver margin. 
Right rib cage nontender. 
EXTREMITIES: Demonstrated 1+ bilateral pitting edema with palpable pulses bilaterally , they were cool. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION: Normal electrolytes with serum creatinine of 0.8. White blood count 9.7. 
Hematocrit 32.2. 
Platelets 225. 
Serial CK's were obtained and were 35 , 36 , and 31. 
Dedimer was 411. 
Troponin I was 0.01. 
Electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial flutter with a 4 to 1 block at 65 beats per minute without ST-T wave changes. 
He ambulated times four minus with a D sat from 95% to 90 to 92 %. HOSPITAL COURSE: This 66 year-old male with coronary disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft with an Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complained of excellerating shortness of breath times six months with minimal exertion. 
After a presentation with low intermediate pre-test probability for pulmonary embolus , we obtained a VQ scan that was determiend to be intermediate probability. 
The patient was then referred for a coronary angiography. 
This was performed on 2/23 and revealed three vessel native coronary disease and one occluded bypass graft. 
Left anterior descending artery had a discrete mid 50 % stenosis occluded distally. 
The ramus had a smooth discrete 80% stenosis. 
The left circumflex artery was totally occluded proximally. 
The right coronary artery was also totally occluded but in the midportion. 
Of the graft , the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was patent. 
Saphenous vein grafts to the ramus was totally occluded at the Tessio site. 
SVG to the right coronary artery was patent. 
Lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative for deep venous thrombosis. 
The patient's dyspnea on exertion was deemed to be due to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and the patient was discharged on appropriate anti-hypertensive and ischemic medical regimen for follow up with his cardiologist , Dr. Cara Barnaba on 5/29 in stable condition. 
MEDICATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg po q day , Atenolol 50 mg po q am , NPH Humulin Insulin 20 units qam , 4 units qhs subcutaneously , Regular Insulin on a sliding scale , lisinopril 10 mg po qam , Sublingual Nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain q 5 minutes times 3 , Simvastatin 20 mg po qhs , Micforman 1 gram po bid , Plavix 75 mg po qam , Lasix 20 mg po qam.
