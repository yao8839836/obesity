Discharge Date: 1/13/2006 ATTENDING: DEPSKY , GWYNETH ALMEDA MD PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Desirae Marcott , M.D. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. Acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency. 
2. Congestive heart failure. 
3. Diabetes. 
4. Hypertension. 5. History of upper gastrointestinal bleed. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old gentleman with history of COPD , CHF , and stage IV chronic renal insufficiency , who presented to the emergency room on 8/26/2005 with wheezing and shortness of breath following a three-day prodrome of cough , congestion , and chills. 
In the emergency room , the patient was noted to have a BNP of 519 and was initially treated with Lasix in the emergency room , and was admitted at that point for diagnosis of COPD exacerbation in the setting of an upper respiratory infection in addition to mild congestive heart failure. 
The patient was given oral glucocorticoids and frequent bronchodilator therapy was initiated. 
However , the patient's mental status began to rapidly decline. 
As he became more somnolent , he was noted to have an ABG with a pH of 7.16. 
The patient was then transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure after failing an initial trial of BiPAP. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , requiring at least two prior intubations; congestive heart failure , previously thought to be diastolic with an EF of 50%; diabetes , hypertension , history of upper GI bleed in 5/20 secondary to an antral ulcer , pneumonia in 7/20 left lower lobe nodule , which is stable on followup CTs; chronic renal insufficiency , thought secondary to diabetes and hypertension. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a former smoker with rare alcohol use. 
He lives alone and he is a retired chef. 
Father had congestive heart failure. 
Brother has a history of pituitary cancer and another brother with lymphoma. 
HOME MEDICATIONS: 1. Amiloride 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2. Clonodine 7.5 mg topically weekly. 
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily. 
4. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5. Lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. Labetalol 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. 7. NPH 25 units in the morning and 15 units in the evening.

Albuterol/Combivent. ALLERGIES: IBUPROFEN WITH WORSENING RENAL FAILURE. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION: Temperature 100.6 , heart rate 88 , respiratory rate 28 , blood pressure 158/90 , and saturating 99% on 2 L nasal cannula. 
General: This is a pleasant , mildly overweight African-American male visibly wheezing and speaking in short phrases. 
HEENT: Pupils are equal , round , and reactive to light. 
Oropharynx is clear. 
Neck: Supple. 
No lymphadenopathy. 
Cardiovascular: Tachycardic. 
No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
JVP was increased. 
Respiratory: Crackles , bibasilar. 
Notable for diffuse wheezes. 
Minimal air movement. 
Peak flow was measured at 200. 
Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and nondistended. 
Bowel sounds are present. 
Extremities: Mild clubbing and trace edema bilaterally. 
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Notable for electrolyte panel within normal limits. 
BUN of 52 , creatinine of 3.3 , and glucose of 154. 
BNP was 317. 
Hemogram showed a white blood cell count of 7.7 , hematocrit 40.6 , and platelets 219. 
MCV was low at 80. Chest x-ray showed interstitial edema , no infiltrates. 
EKG showed no acute changes from prior. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 65-year-old male with history of COPD who is admitted for a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a likely viral URI as well as some mild congestive heart failure exacerbation. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Pulmonary: As noted above , the patient was noted to be having hypercarbic respiratory failure with an ABG of 7.16/98/89 on 3 L nasal cannula. 
He was therefore transferred to the MICU and at that time required intubation. 
The patient's respiratory status improved and he was extubated on 11/5/2005 .  
The patient was initially treated with Solu-Medrol , which was changed to prednisone on 4/20/2005 .  
The patient was noted to have thick tenacious secretions and there was concern for possible pneumonia as an underlying flare for the patient's COPD. 
Therefore , the patient was initiated on levofloxacin for a 14-day course. 
The patient had , upon presentation , been noted to be mildly volume overloaded but this improved with diuresis prior to his MICU stay. 
In the setting of the patient's intubation , his pH corrected slowly , but he was still noted to have markedly elevated partial CO2 pressures. 
The patient was treated with chest PT as well as Duonebs. 
Following extubation , the patient was transferred to the floor and did well. 
Medications were adjusted and he was continued on a prednisone taper , Spiriva , Advair 250/50 Diskus , supplemental oxygen , Duonebs , and albuterol nebulizers as needed. 
The patient continued to improve , and on 9/3/2005 , he was able to ambulate on room air without dyspnea or hypoxia. 
At this point , we suggest outpatient pulmonary function tests to further evaluate the extent of the patient's obstructive disease. 
Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient underwent a negative rule out MI upon admission. 
This was obtained due to the newly decreased EF of 35 to 40% that was noted on echocardiogram upon admission. 
The patient has not had any ischemic symptoms; however , this marked decrease is concerning especially including the inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis , which is new from his prior echocardiogram. 
The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin. 
An ACE inhibitor was reinitiated when the patient's creatinine stabilized. 
The patient will likely need further cardiac risk stratification as an outpatient to include an outpatient stress test. 
Pump: As mentioned , upon admission , the patient was noted to have mild volume overload. 
He has a history of diastolic dysfunction with a prior echocardiogram showing an EF of 50%. 
As noted , the most recent echocardiogram obtained during this hospitalization shows an EF of 35% with diffuse global hypokinesis and inferior posterior wall akinesis. 
There was mild decreased function of the RV as well , and mild left atrial enlargement and mild right atrial enlargement. 
The patient is noted to have relatively stable pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 50 plus right atrial pressure. 
The patient had been diuresed aggressively in the emergency room and therefore did not require additional diuresis upon transfer to the MICU. 
The patient was initiated on hydralazine and Isordil for afterload reduction. 
When the patient's creatinine stabilized , these were changed back to an ACE inhibitor. 
The patient was continued on a beta-blocker as well. 
The patient was restarted on half of his home dose of Lasix at Lasix 160 mg p.o. daily as of 1/6/2006 when he was noted to be mildly hypervolemic. 
In addition , the patient was noted to have significant hypertension. 
He has had a workup previously for secondary causes of hypertension , which included a negative MRA in 2004. 
The patient was continued on a clonodine patch as well as beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor , and Imdur. 
The patient's home medication of hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued , as was the amiloride , which may need to be reinitiated as an outpatient. 
Rhythm: The patient was noted to have four beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on 11/7/2005 , which resolved with aggressive electrolyte replacement. 
While in the MICU , the patient had a single run of 30 beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which improved with electrolyte replacement. 
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and therefore was continued on a regimen of NPH initially at 20 units b.i.d. 
The patient was noted to have an episode of hypoglycemia with blood sugars around 40 and therefore the NPH was decreased and the patient will be discharged on a regimen of 15 units in the morning and 10 units at bedtime. 
The patient was also noted to have hyperparathyroidism likely from renal disease , therefore secondary versus tertiary hyperparathyroidism. 
The patient was therefore continued on calcitriol. 
Renal: The patient has stage IV chronic renal insufficiency. 
Upon admission , the patient was noted to be oliguric. 
This is likely due to a prerenal state given diuresis on admission and further exacerbated by the patient's underlying renal disease. 
Bladder scan was obtained which only showed 3 mL of urine in the bladder. 
The patient's urine output increased with afterload reduction. 
The patient was noted to have acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis with chronic bicarbonate compensation. 
There was no anion gap. 
The lactate was measured and was only 0.6 in the MICU. 
Throughout the remainder of the hospitalization , the patient's creatinine continued to improve and was measured at 3.4 on 1/6/2006 .  
A renal consult was obtained during the hospitalization. 
They did not feel that there was any indication for acute renal replacement. 
The patient should continue to have renally dosed meds and continue on a renal diet , including Phoslo. 
The patient will have close renal followup within the next few weeks. 
Hematologic: The patient was noted to have iron deficiency anemia and was started on ferrous sulfate supplementation. 
At this time , an EPO level is still pending. 
Infectious Disease: The patient was initiated on levofloxacin for a 14-day course , which was started on 4/13/2005 , and will be completed as of 9/11/2006 .  
Blood cultures and sputum cultures were obtained and are negative to date. 
Influenza/adenovirus/RSV swabs were obtained and were negative. 
Prophylaxis: The patient received heparin subcutaneous 5000 units t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis , and was continued on Pepcid for GI prophylaxis. 
DISPOSITION: The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and felt to be at his baseline. 
He is able to ambulate and maintain his pulse oxymetry greater than 93%. 
The patient will be discharged to home with visiting nurse service. 
TO DO: 1. VNA is to check the patient's blood pressure , oxygen saturation , as well as check weekly electrolytes and creatinine levels and call results to Dr. Hoban office at 658-680-1482. 
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Romig within the next week , and at that time , should have his blood pressure meds titrated up as needed. 
The patient may require increased dose of Lasix and the amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be resumed as needed. 
2. The patient should have a cardiology outpatient followup regarding his decreased EF and new wall motion abnormalities. 
The patient may require stress imaging for further cardiac risk stratification. 
3. The patient should have renal follow up regarding his chronic renal insufficiency and future need for hemodialysis.
