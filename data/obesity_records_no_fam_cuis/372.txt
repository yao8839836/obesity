HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 57 year old morbidly obese man with extensive past medical history now admitted with progressive dyspnea over the past two weeks and studies showing pulmonary embolism. 
The patient was started on intravenous Heparin. 
The dose of Heparin was increased until his PTT was in the range of 60 to 80 seconds. 
Oral anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated at 15 mg each night. 
After three nights of therapy , the patient's INR was 1.4 so his dose was increased to 20 mg per night.

Allopurinol was also started for uric acid levels of 7.9. 
The patient had symptoms of sinusitis likely from his use of BiPAP at home. 
He was started on trimethoprim/sulfamoxole double-strength twice a day. 
Physical therapy was initiated. 
The patient was able to transfer himself from bed to chair and was able to ambulate approximately sixty feet with minimal dyspnea.
