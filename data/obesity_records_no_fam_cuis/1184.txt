BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ( to CCU admission ): The patient was admitted to PUO on 5/25/06. 
He had been behaving unlike himself and was having black tarry stools for two days. 
The patient was found to be guaiac positive. 
A head CT showed no new lesions but did show multiple infarcts that were known to be old. 
On 10/18/06 , the patient had an EGD showing clot in the distal esophagus. 
This clot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped.

He was not in any acute distress. 
He was alert and oriented x3. 
He was interactive and appropriate. 
Skin was normal. 
HEENT showed an old left-sided facial droop which was unchanged per patient and the family. 
The JVP was 6 cm. 
There was no lymphadenopathy. 
The chest was clear. 
Cardiac exam showed a mechanical S1 and normal S2 , no extra sounds or murmurs. 
Abdominal exam was benign. 
Extremities had 2+ pulses without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. 
Neurological exam showed a left-sided facial hemiparesis. 
Otherwise , cranial nerves II through XII were intact. 
The patient had 4/5 strength on the left side , 5/5 strength on the right side. 
Toes were downgoing. 
ADMISSION LABS: Labs on admission were notable for a creatinine of 1.7 , glucose of 237 , hematocrit of 37. OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: 10/18/06 , elective inpatient EGD for heme-positive black stool performed by Dr. Natisha Longaker in the presence of Dr. Lorretta Cridge On 11/16/06 , urgent cardiac cathet1erization for cardiac arrest performed by Dr. Jeannette Mendonsa with stent placement in the circumflex. 
On 4/22/06 , dual chamber ICD placed by Dr. Brumet HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease and mitral valve replacement. 
He was initially admitted for an upper GI bleed and was then admitted to the CCU status post V-fib arrest and found to have NSTEMI. 
His course in the CCU was as follows: 1. Cardiovascular: A. Ischemia: NSTEMI. 
The patient had a troponin elevation beginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the NSTEMI occurred and then caused V-fib arrest. 
The peak troponin was 111. 
Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease , and occlusion of the SVG graft. 
Two drug-eluting stents were placed in the left circumflex. 
The patient was treated with aspirin , Plavix , beta-blocker , and ACE. 
The patient's beta-blocker and ACE doses were titrated during his hospital stay. 
The patient was also taken off of Lipitor briefly due to concern about his liver function. 
At discharge , he is being restarted on his outpatient doses of Lipitor as well as a Fibrate. 
B. Pump: The patient had congestive heart failure causing pulmonary edema. 
By echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30% with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe global hypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. 
The patient diuresed well during his CCU stay and on the floor. 
His I's and O's were followed. 
He was net negative , and he was discharged at a weight of 87 kilos. 
The patient had an echo to evaluate for dyssynchrony. 
This echo did not find significant evidence of dyssynchrony. 
C. Rhythm: The patient had a V-fib arrest and returned to normal sinus rhythm. 
He received an amiodarone load as well as amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. 
After he stabilized , the amiodarone was discontinued after AICD implantation on on 7/1/06. 
The implantation itself was uncomplicated though the patient developed hives thought to be due to administration of prophylactic Ancef. 
The patient was switched to vancomycin for prophylaxis , followed by po clindamycin. 
His allergic symptoms resolved with one dose of IV Benadryl. 
2. GI: The patient came in with an upper GI bleed. 
A bleeding vessel at the GE junction was clipped. 
The patient had a transient LFT elevation consistent with shock liver. 
LFTs were followed and declined appropriately during his hospitalization and normalized before discharge. 
The patient was also maintained on a proton pump inhibitor during his stay. 
3. Hematocrit: The patient was transfused two units of red blood cells on 4/12/06 and 9/28/06. 
His hematocrit remained stable therafter. 
The patient was taking Lovenox as an outpatient for protection of his mechanical mitral valve. 
During the peri-procedure period for his ICD implantation , the patient was switched to heparin drip and was maintained on the heparin drip for four days after device implantation. 
At that time , he was restarted on his outpatient regimen of Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d. 4. Neuro: The patient has a history of CVA with a residual left hemiparesis. 
These symptoms were stable. 
The patient was also seen by the Psychiatry Service to evaluate his memory deficits and abilities to make decisions. 
The Psychiatry team recommended that the patient be followed by Neurology after discharge and that the patient be considered for a formal neuropsychiatric testing for evaluation of his neurologic and cognitive deficits. 
5. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary edema resolved with diuresis. 
6. ID: The patient presented with fever and an elevated white blood cell count initially and a question of an infiltrate on chest x-ray. 
This patient was covered with levofloxacin and Flagyl for three days empirically for aspiration pneumonia. 
During hospitalization , he did have very transient low-grade temperatures on two other occasions. 
Cultures including chest x-ray , urine and blood cultures were negative. 
The patient was afebrile prior to discharge. 
As of the day of this dictation , C. difficile tests were also negative. 
7. Renal: The patient's creatinine was elevated reaching a peak of 1.9 on 4/12/06 in the setting of his cardiac arrest. 
The patient's creatinine normalized and on the day prior to discharge was 1.2. 8. Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow. 
Initially , he was put on a puree-thin diet that was advanced to mechanical soft and thin liquids prior to discharge. 
9. Endocrine: The patient is diabetic and was maintained on NPH 22 units b.i.d. and a sliding scale. 
At the time of discharge , the patient's blood sugars were well controlled. 
He is being discharged on Lantus 48 units at bedtime ( a light increase over his outpatinet dose ) as well as a NovoLog sliding scale for coverage during meals.
