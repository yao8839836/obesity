RFA: Hereditary angioedema abdominal flare .

HPI: 83 F with hereditary angio-edema ( C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency ) and multiple prior attacks characterized by abdominal pain and distension and airway compromise s/p tracheostomy. 
She was in her USOH until this morning when she developed worsening abdominal pain , periumbilical , constant. 
The pain was associated with abdominal distension and typical of prior attacks. 
No new foods - typically these episodes are without an identifiable precipitant. 
No associated nausea/vomiting or diarrhea.

Typical BM's are either watery or "pencil thin" due to colonic stricture ( s/p multiple dilatations.

In the past , abdominal attacks have responded to FFP.

1. ALLERGY: Patient was admitted with abdominal pain that was similar in nature to prior episodes of hereditary angioedema flare. 
She was treated with ffp x 2units on admission with benadryl premedication. 
She did develop a few facial hives without any respiratory distress by the end of the second unit of FFP. 
This resolved after FFP infusion stopped and she was given additional benadryl. 
She tolerated benadryl well , yet had a sensation of restlessness afterwards. 
On 4/4 she got another 2 units FFP with premedication of benadyrl 25 iv prior to each bag as well as ativan 0.5 mg po prior to transfusions. 
This was a good combination as she did not get hives , nor the anxiety that accompanies benadryl. 
By 8/21 , her abdominal distension had improved markedly and her pain had largely subsided. 
Given the fact that prior episodes have taken a few days for complete resolution of distension , she was discharged with instructions to contact her immunologist should symptoms worsen or persist. 
She will be discharged on a stanozolol taper as outlined by allergy/immuno. 
Please see patient instructions full regimen. . 
During the hospital stay , she had no upper air way symptoms and was given tracheostomy care. . 
ELEVATED HCT: On admission , HCT was 59 ( baselin is low 40's ). 
Part of the elevation was attributed to intravascular volume depletion. 
Lasix was held for 3 days and HCT was 42% on discharge. 
No prior documented history of polycythemia. 
Please consider further evaluation as outpatient for this erythrocytosis. 
. 
AFib: continued on digoxin and atenolol with good rate control ( HR 70-80s throughout hospital stay. ) CODE: Discussed with patient.
