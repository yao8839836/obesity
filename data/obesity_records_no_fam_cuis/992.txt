938996420 | PUO | 49555188 | | 359807 | 1/10/1993 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 10/9/1993 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 2/13/1993 SERVICE: MEDICINE PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION. 
PROBLEM LIST: 1. POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA. 2. LUMBAR DISK DISEASE. 
3. HYPERTENSION. 
4. COR PULMONALE. 5. TOBACCO SMOKER. 
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the Emergency Ward with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. 
She was intubated for somnolence and worsening respiratory acidosis , and transferred to the MICU. 
She had never had any intubations previously. 
She is an active smoker with a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who is followed by Dr. Reyes Mcpeck Most recently , she was admitted on 8/5/92 for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation which was treated with aggressive bronchodilators. 
Her baseline ABG on discharge was 7.39 , pC02 51.1 , and a p02 of 66 with 91.3% 02 saturation. 
She had a previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. 
Her most recent thyroid function tests on 8/6 revealed an FEV1 of 38% and an FVC of 51% , with an FEV1/FVC of less than 80%. 
This was felt to be consistent with a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern. 
She has been treated with Theophylline and Proventil as well as home nebulizers , Lasix , and 02 overnight. 
She continues to smoke as well as noted above. 
She has had frequent episodes of cough and productive sputum as well as lower extremity edema. 
She now presents with one to two weeks of increase in her postnasal drip , denying any change in her cough or sputum production although she did note a slightly increased temperature. 
She began to become more short of breath and was taken to the Emergency Ward by her sister. 
There , she was found to be cyanotic with an 02 saturation of 59%. 
Her first blood gas on 50% was 7.27 , pCO2 79 , p02 78% saturation after one nebulizer treatment. 
Her peak flows after three nebulizers were only 90. 
She began to become somnolent with a repeat blood gas showing a pCO2 of 94 , and was therefore intubated and transferred to the MICU. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Was remarkable for ( 1 ) asthma/COPD , ( 2 ) polymyalgia rheumatica , ( 3 ) borderline hypertension , ( 4 ) lumbar disk disease , ( 5 ) psoriasis , ( 6 ) right sided heart failure , ( 7 ) spinal stenosis , ( 8 ) sinusitis , ( 9 ) obesity. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cholecystectomy in 1979 , status post back surgery. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Theo-Dur 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , KCL , Lodine 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Proventil nebulizers p.r.n. , supplemental 02 q.h.s. 
ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO SULFA WHICH CAUSES HER TO HAVE A RASH. HABITS: She continues to smoke , and she has a history of 40 pack years. 
There is no alcohol use. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. 
She has two sons. 
She is assisted by her sister. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was an intubated , obese female in no acute distress. 
Her blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 70-100 , and temperature of 101.6. 
HEENT was unremarkable. 
Neck: Supple with no jugular venous distention. 
Lungs revealed diffuse wheezes with an I:E ratio of 1:4. 
Heart: Tachycardiac with a normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
Breasts: No masses. 
Abdomen: Obese , mild tenderness to deep palpation , normal bowel sounds. 
Extremities: 2+ edema to her calves bilaterally , no clubbing. 
Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses. 
On neurological exam , she was awake but lethargic and difficult to arouse , but was able to move all extremities. 
Her reflexes were 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. 
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.6 , glucose 113. 
Her liver function tests were within normal limits. 
Her white count was 9.96 , 76 polys , 15 lymphs. 
Her hematocrit was 47.6% with 265 , 000 platelets. 
The PT was 11.4 , and the PTT was 30.5. 
Theophylline level was 5.3. 
ABG's were as mentioned above. 
Post intubation , ABG 7.45 , pCO2 41 , p02 57 , with 91% saturation. 
The most recent echocardiogram in 1/11 revealed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function. 
The chest x-ray revealed an increased heart size with no infiltrates. 
The urinalysis revealed too numerous to count white blood cells and 4+ bacteria. 
Cultures eventually grew out E. coli. 
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an axis of +8 , right bundle branch block , inverted T's in V1 and V2 , but no significant change compared with 11/1 HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and continued on the ventilator until 3/6/93. 
She was given aggressive bronchodilator treatment via nebulizers , Albuterol and Atropent. 
She was started on IV Solu-Medrol dose which was rapidly tapered on a p.o. schedule. 
She also received two days of IV Ceftriaxone to cover a possible tracheobronchitis. 
She was also continued on her Ancef as well. 
Her urinary tract infection was treated via the Ceftriaxone. 
She did well over the next two days and essentially was ready for extubation on this regimen on 3/6/93. 
She was watched overnight and did continue to do well , and was transferred to the floor on 6/14/93. 
By this time , her 02 saturations were 92% on two liters. 
She was afebrile , and her peak flows were improving with continued Albuterol nebulizers and Atrovent inhaler. 
Her polymyalgia rheumatica remained stable during her admission. 
There was a question whether or not her urinary tract infection was adequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000 colonies of Staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. 
These were clean catches. 
She had it repeated one more time as a clean catch , and this was found to grow probable Pseudomonas species , with an exact speciation pending. 
This last culture on 5/17/93 was associated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. 
Because of this and because of the low cell count , I did not feel that it was necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cath specimen was obtained. 
The patient was informed that if her dysuria were to persist that she was to call Dr. Burle immediately , but that otherwise , her urine was most likely noninfected. 
She also received a sleep study on 1/16/93 which revealed that her oxygen saturations dropped to 46% during REM sleep. 
This was at a point when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had an element of essential sleep apnea. 
She also during periods of non-REM sleep alternated between breathing against an obstruction and not breathing at all. 
This revealed that she also has a component of obstructive sleep apnea as well. 
She was started on Progesterone as an outpatient and will continue to be followed for evaluation for possible nasal C-PAP. 
The patient was discharged on 8/19/93 with a continued good airflow and much fewer wheezes than previously. 
There were no complications.
