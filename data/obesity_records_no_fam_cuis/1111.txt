Found this afternoon by family unresponsive , frothing at the mouth. 
FS=30 by EMS and D50 ampule given with increased responsiveness. 
Was oriented by PUO ED but suddenly experienced 7-8/10 SSCP w/SOB/N/diaphoresis. 
ST elevations in II , III , aVF , V4-V6 w/ TWI I , aVL observed in this context. 
NTG and morphine led to resolution of symptoms 1-2/10. 
EKG normalized with correction of blood sugar and anti-anginals ( i.e. by time pt reached floor ). 
Additinally , pt HTN to sbp 170 and tachy 100-110s: given lopressor 5mg IV x2 and 25mg PO. 
She also received ASA and 5000U heparin dose w/ 1000U/hr drip. 
She was repeatedly hypoglhcemic on the floor , at least once to the 30s.

She initally had difficulty maintaining her blood sugars and was given another amp of d50 and orange juice on the floor. 
After the first 12 hours , her blood sugars have been consistently over 120. 
Although she was very enzyme posive for NSTEMI ( MB 31.2--&gt;32.4--&gt;15.4 today ) , chest pain did not recur. 
IN fact , her EKG has been normal since arriving on the floor. 
Therefore , her episode of ischemia was thought to be demand related ischemia in the context of hypoglycemia. 
Causes of the hypoglycemia included hypoth yroidism , adrenal insufficiency , and iatrogenesis. 
Given the finite duration of the hypoglycemia , the latter possibility was deemed most likely ( TSH , AM cortisol wnl ). 
The patient's cardiac enzymes have peaked ( MB: 31.2--&gt;31.4--&gt; 
15.4 ). 
The patient's home situation has been previouisly known to be suboptimal--she had a son who may have been dealing drugs in her home 2 years ago. 
This time , there was concern over potential tension betwee her and her estranged husband or medication errors. 
Social work was called and spoke with the daughter. 
She appears to be appropriately concerned about her mother's health and open to the idea of placement in an assisted living facility at some later date. 
It is clear that an elaborate and effective system has been worked out to monitor and treat the patient's blood sugars. 
The patients visiting nurse service ( Stalbri Rehabilitation Hospital ) was contacted to reemphasize the importance of evaluating the patient's medication regimen. 
The nurse involved in the patient's care also will initiate a request for a home health aide to visit the patient more frequently. 
Elder services was informed to initiate a consult. 
The social worker at Whidd Ton Medical Center was also informed of this admission. 
The patient's home situation is deemed safe for discharge. 
She will follow up with Dr. Grap on November VNA will visit her tommorrow. 
The patient's hematocrit dropped slightly the day of dischar ge. 
However , the patient was guaiac negative. 
Parenthetically , the patient had a slightly dirty UA on admission. 
She was initially treated but given her lack of symptoms , this was discontinued. 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your insulin dosage has been decreased because your blood sugar was too low. 
Your visiting nurse should check your blood sugars and call your physician if they are consistently above 150. 
Your dose of lipitor has been increased because your LDL on this admission was 92. DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: No dictated summary ENTERED BY: GOLDFEDER , MAXINE , M.D. , PH.D. ( OA25 ) 10/18/04 @ 04 ****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******
