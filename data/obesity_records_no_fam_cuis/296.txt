Discharge Date: 10/8/2005 ATTENDING: TAPLIN , AVRIL MD SERVICE: CFH .  
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Rule out MI. PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Angina , tachycardia , and hypertension. 
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Hypertension , chest pain , GERD , coronary artery disease , osteoarthritis , anxiety , diverticulosis , hypercholesterolemia , and chronic dizziness. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 80-year-old woman with history of coronary artery disease and difficult to control hypertension who presented with chest pain in the setting of the elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. 
Two days prior to admission , the patient had developed the abrupt onset of palpitation , chest pain , diaphoresis , anxiety , and shortness of breath. 
She took her blood pressure and this was found to be greater than 200 with the rapid pulse. 
She called her PCP and was instructed to call 911. 
She was taken to the Pagham University Of ED. Of note , she had not taken her Toprol-XL for the prior three days. 
In the emergency department , the systolic blood pressure was in the 180s. 
This was controlled with her home medications and IV Lopressor. 
The patient was ruled out for an MI in ED/OBS. 
She went for a MIBI on the morning of admission , but this was canceled because the patient was dizzy. 
Of note , the patient has had an identical admission several months earlier for a labile blood pressure. 
During that admission , the patient's hydralazine and beta-blocker was titrated up with improved blood pressure control. 
She was ruled out for pheochromocytoma and renal artery stenosis. 
She did have elevated plasma metanephrines during that admission. 
She was discharged at that point on an improved antihypertensive regimen as described above. 
She also reports having had a similar episode two weeks ago.

ALLERGIES: ACE inhibitor , amlodipine , and niacin. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: No smoking , no ethanol. 
She lives in Ment Lum by herself , has a helper ( visiting aid ). 
No family nearby. 
Her family lives in Naand Hwy. 
Her mother died at 75 years old with CVA. 
Her sister had an MI at age 80. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs: Heart rate 98 , blood pressure 172/70 with a range of 103-172/40-70. 
O2 saturation was 97% on room air. 
Her exam was significant for tachycardia with a regular rate , normal S1 and S2 , and soft systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. 
The remainder of the exam was unremarkable. 
LABS ON ADMISSION: CBC was within normal limits. 
Chem-7 was significant for BUN of 22 and creatinine of 103. 
Calcium was 10.5 , phosphorus was 2.5 , and albumin was 4.3. 
LFTs were normal. 
Her D-dimer was 1305. 
She had two sets of negative cardiac enzymes. 
Coags were normal. 
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 75 beats per minute , left axis deviation , LVH , left atrial enlargement. 
T-wave flatting in lead III only. 
STUDIES: 1. Chest x-ray ( 9/29/05 ): No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
2. PE CT ( 11/9/05 ): No PE. 3. Head CT ( 11/9/05 ): Left-sided meningiomas , unchanged from 2004. 4. MIBI ( 10/27/05 ): Area of reversible ischemia , unchanged from 2002. 
CONSULTS: Cardiology ( MMC ): Jenell Alysia Haarstad . 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: 1. Paroxysmal hypertension/tachycardia: This was in the setting of not taking her Toprol. 
She does have a history of labile blood pressure and difficult to control hypertension. 
This symptom was thought to look very much like pheochromocytoma , but this was ruled out last admission. 
Renal artery stenosis was also ruled out last admission. 
Given the description and the fact that she had elevated plasma metanephrines on the previous admission , one possible diagnosis that was considered with pseudo pheochromocytoma. 
Studies for pheochromocytoma , pseudo pheochromocytoma , carcinoid , and hypothyroidism ( including 24-hour urine metanephrines were sent ) these all returned as negative. 
Her TSH was normal. 
She was initially put on q.i.d. 
Lopressor and hydralazine. 
The hydralazine was then discontinued due to hypotension. 
Her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL , this was also discontinued for hypotension. 
Her ultimate regimen was titrated based on her blood pressures and eventually she was put on Avapro 75 mg daily , atenolol 25 mg daily , and her home dose of Imdur 120 mg daily. 
Her target blood pressures were 140s to 150s and with this regimen , she was well controlled and asymptomatic upon discharge. 
2. Ischemia: She was initially ruled out for MI. 
Her MIBI showed reversible ischemia unchanged from 2002 despite two catheterizations in intervening time. 
She was seen by MMC Cardiology , and this defect was felt to be nonintervenable. 
She was discharged home in stable condition and chest pain free. 
3. Dizziness/nausea: She had episodes of this during her hospitalization. 
It was of unclear etiology and she has had a previous significant prior workup ( see previous discharge summary ). 
She received p.r.n. meclizine and Compazine and was discharged home without any dizziness or nausea. 
4. Calcium: She had borderline high calcium and a PTH was sent and returned mildly elevated. 
This will need to be followed up as an outpatient. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. 
TO DO PLAN: Further workup for question of elevated PTH in the setting of high calcium suggestive of hyperparathyroidism. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily. 
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily. 
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4. Lasix 40 mg daily.
