Abdominal CT: 1. Ventral hernia containing nonobstructive transverse colon. 
2. Nonspecific low-attenuation segment VII hepatic lesion 3. Oral contrast remains in the stomach. 
KUB postcontrast: Oral contrast from the CT abdomen and pelvis remains in the stomach suggesting possibility of gastric atony versus outlet obstruction. 
EGD: Hypomotility of the stomach , no ulcerations , biopsies taken. 
Normal pylorus and normal duodenum. 
KUB post-EGD: No free air or obstruction. 
Gastric emptying study: Mildly delayed emptying , no reflux. 
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis and intervals , right bundle-branch block , no ST or T-wave changes. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Following several studies in the emergency department as well as consultations from the gastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient was thought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis given the findings on the EGD and CT as well as the negative ultrasound and KUB. 
The gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to his diabetes. 
He was admitted to the medical service and his diet was slowly increased. 
On the floor , his pain continued , and within two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102. 
He had a repeat abdominal CT , which showed a distended gallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensive stranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acute acalculous cholecystitis. 
Surgery was reconsulted , and the patient was taken to the operating room where he had an exploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an open cholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. 
The patient received perioperative vancomycin , Levaquin , and Flagyl and continued to do well post surgery with advancement of his diet and decrease in his pain medication requirement. 
Vancomycin was discontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. 
He was continued on the Levaquin and Flagyl. 
He had a drain that was left in following surgery , and this was pulled on 4/14/2006 .  
Following the pulling of the drain , he developed leakage of green-tinged serous fluid from his abdominal wound. 
An abdominal CT was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess. 
An ERCP was done which showed a cystic duct stump bile leak. 
They did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no further leak. 
The patient was continued on empiric Levaquin and Flagyl following the procedure. 
His diet was advanced and he tolerated this well. 
He had no further pain. 
He is being discharged on a total of seven days of Levaquin and Flagyl following the bile leak. 
Endocrine: The patient was continued on lower-dose insulin while he was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased. 
Cardiovascular: The patient was followed by the cardiac transplant team. 
He was initially switched to IV cyclosporine and his CellCept was held. 
These were transitioned to p.o. and restarted following his improvement. 
Postoperatively , he got stress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this was then tapered to Solu-Medrol and then back to prednisone at his home dose. 
He was fluid overloaded following the surgery. 
He got 100 of IV Lasix times several doses , and then restarted on his torsemide to maintain euvolemia. 
His Cartia was initially discontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , but this was then restarted. 
He was discharged on all his home medications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m. 
Rheumatology: Following his surgery , he developed bilateral elbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout. 
The rheumatology service was consulted. 
A left elbow tap was attempted , but this did not return any fluid. 
He was given several doses of colchicine p.r.n. with improvement. 
The steroid taper was slowed and his gout improved. 
He was discharged without any elbow pain. 
Phlebitis: He developed left arm phlebitis secondary to an infiltrating IV. 
This was covered by his antibiotics that were started for his cholecystitis and his arm improved.
