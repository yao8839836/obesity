The patient was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm2 an EF of 60%. 
The patient does have a history of positive stress test for which a cardiac catheterization was performed in 6/29 .  
At that time , he was found to have 40% lesion of the LAD.

EKG showed no acute changes. 
The patient was placed ACS protocol and initially admitted to the Cardiology Service. 
The Cardiac Surgery Service was consulted for emergent aortic valve repair and potential coronary artery bypass grafting.

3. Diabetes mellitus. 
4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Status post right upper extremity AV fistula.

IMAGING: 1. Cardiac catheterization on 1/11/04 performed at Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of , 40% proximal LAD lesion , codominant circulation. 
2. Echocardiogram on 5/13 , aortic stenosis with mean gradient 62 mmHg , peak gradient of 82 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency , trivial mitral insufficiency , LVH EF of 50%. 
3. EKG on 10/21/05 , normal sinus rhythm at 70 with first-degree AV block , evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. 
4. Chest x-ray on 10/21/05 , interstitial pulmonary edema. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 10/17/05 , the patient was brought to the operating room for critical aortic stenosis , acute coronary syndrome and acute pulmonary edema. 
He underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #21 Carpentier-Edwards magna valve , as well as a coronary artery bypass graft x1 with LIMA to LAD. Bypass time was 120 minutes and crossclamp time 90 minutes. 
Two atrial wires and one ventricular wire was placed. 
Please see the operative note for further details. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well. 
He was extubated with without incident on postoperative day #1. 
His neurologic status was in time and he did not suffer any delirium as witnessed after his initial emergence from anesthesia during the renal transplantation. 
He was noted to have significant oral secretions , but these were clear and thin. 
On postoperative day #1 , his femoral arterial line was removed and his renal transplantation medications restarted. 
His CK-MB peaked at 46 and did trend down thereafter. 
On postoperative day #2 , he had begun to be diuresed in light persistent pulmonary edema and seen by chest x-ray. 
His chest tubes were removed without incident. 
On postoperative day #3 , he was hemodynamically stable. 
His FK levels were noted to be low , as is historically the case with him. 
Renal Transplant Medicine was following and did titrated his medications as necessary. 
On postoperative day #4 , his final left chest tube was removed. 
Post-pull chest x-ray showed the lung to be well expanded. 
He was found to be hyponatremic with a sodium of approximately 130. 
He was begun on fluid restriction of 1.5 liters for hematocrit of 21. 
A 1 unit of packed red blood cells was also given at this time and he was continued on diuresis. 
On postoperative day #5 , as his preoperatively weight had been reached , he was taken off of diuresis. 
His renal transplantation medications discontinue. 
The patient was up out of bed and ambulating well. 
The patient was also noted to have a large sacral decubitus ulcer , without exposure of bone. 
This ulcer was the result of the previous admission in January after renal transplantation. 
The Plastic Surgery Service was consulted and their recommendations included appropriate therapeutic support surface , frequent turning with minimization of being in the seated position , optimization of nutrition , and wet-to-dry dressings to the wound. 
The service is still following the patient and will consider VAC dressing and the later time.
