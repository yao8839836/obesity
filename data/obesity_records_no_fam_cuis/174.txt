She also noted bilateral LEE , PND , and fatigue. 
She has HTN that was well-controlled , so as her DM II. 
Her last Echo in 2004 showed EF of 60% with LVH. 
ROS is otherwise negative for orthopnea , change in appetite , or weight , new flu- like symptoms , history of DVT and pain in calfs.

**** Hospital course: This is a lovely 79 year-old lady with multiple risk factors for atheroscosis , including long standing HTN with evidence of LVH on Echo from 2004 , DM II complicated by neuropathy , hyperlipidemia , and age. 
She presented with overt symptoms and clinical signs of congestive heart failure , including complaints of progressive shortness of breath , PND , fatigue , and peripheral edema. 
Her physical exam was significant for an elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displaced PMI , and S3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure. 
Even though the patient had cardiolmegaly on CXR from 2004 , her LVEF was about 60% , suggesting a recent development of CHF. 
Her EKG showed NSR with new LBBB , and no QW. Due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new LBBB , and evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had a recent ischemic event. 
Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative during her first 24 hours stay. 
She had a stress MIBI showing no scars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated EF of 23%. 
An Echo showed dilated LV , with globaly reduced LE function and near normal pulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy. 
Extensive interviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies of HF , TSH and A1C were normal , and and the cause of her dilated CMP remained undifined. 
she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57Kg , responded well to PO Lasix ( 40-60mg ) , treated also with Toprol XL 25mg , and Spironolactone 12.5mg. 
Her symptos completely resolved both at rest and with gentle ambulation. 
One can argue toward evaluating her coronaray arteries either by cath or CTA to exclude balanced ischemia. 
However considering her age , no changed in EKGs , negative MIBI , and an Echo with globaly reduced EF , we choose to medicaly treat her. 
she will be evaluated in the future for AICD/CRT , then a cath can also be considered. 
She will follow up with Dr. Fernande Prewer .
