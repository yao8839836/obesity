HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Shabel is a 73-year-old male from Tlandmempsa Tiville Grand who is a retired professor of physiology. 
He noted that he had "extra beats" by his primary care physician approximately one year ago. 
The patient had a Holter monitor placed , which reportedly showed many PVCs as well as episodes of AV block. 
He then underwent stress testing and eventual cardiac catheterization in Lanbockter Worce Ma in 2005 , which revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease. 
The patient was referred to Dr. Stukowski for coronary revascularization. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , stroke , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , benign prostatic hypertrophy , and osteoarthritis of both knees. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy in 1955 , open cholecystectomy in 1989 , and TURP in 1998.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ramipril 5 mg p.o. every other day , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , torsemide 20 mg p.o. daily , HCTZ 12.5 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. daily , metformin 500 mg p.o. daily , Amaryl 2 mg p.o. daily , Lantus 20 units nightly , and Ambien 5 mg p.o. nightly. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: Temperature 97.8 , heart rate 76 , blood pressure in the right arm 128/52 , blood pressure in the left arm 122/50. 
HEENT: Dentition without evidence of infection , no carotid bruit. 
Cardiovascular: Slightly irregular rhythm without murmur. 
Peripheral pulses are all 2+ include the carotid , radial , femoral , dorsalis pedis , posterior tibial.

Cardiac catheterization data performed on 2/10/06 , coronary anatomy 70% proximal LAD , 70% mid OM1 , 30% ostial OM1 , 90% proximal RCA , 100% mid RCA , 90% proximal ramus , right dominant circulation. 
ECG on 7/9/06 showed normal sinus rhythm at 77 with multiple PVCs , left anterior hemiblock and right bundle-branch block. 
Chest x-ray on 7/9/06 was read as normal. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: BRIEF OPERATIVE NOTE: DATE OF SURGERY: 9/27/06 . 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease. 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease. 
PROCEDURE: CABG x4 , sequential graft , SVG1 connects aorta to ramus and then OM1 , LIMA to LAD , SVG2 to RCA. BYPASS TIME: 93 minutes. 
CROSSCLAMP TIME: 79 minutes. 
One ventricular wire , two pericardial tubes , one left pleural tube placed. 
The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass on 4 of insulin. 
COMPLICATIONS: None. 
While in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , his course was complicated by the following: 1. 
Although the patient had an allergy of syncope caused by atenolol , he was started on another beta-blocker Lopressor. 
He has not had any complications from this medication. 
He was later transitioned to Toprol in anticipation of his discharge. 
2. He also had a low hematocrit while in the cardiac intensive care unit and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells. 
Since that time , his hematocrit has remained stable. 
He was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #2. 
While on the Cardiac Step-Down Unit , his course was complicated by the following: 1. 
The patient was initially hypertensive upon transfer to cardiac step-down unit and started on captopril. 
His hypertension appears to be under control at this time. 
Otherwise , all epicardial pacing wires and chest tubes were removed without complication and he was weaned from his oxygen requirement and diuresed to approximately her preoperative weight. 
He will be discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative day #5 on the following medications: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. daily , captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Amaryl 2 mg p.o. daily , HCTZ 12.5 mg p.o. daily , NovoLog sliding scale please see attached sliding scale , Lantus 20 units subcutaneous nightly , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. daily , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q. 4h. p.r.n. pain , atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. daily. 
Mr. Shabel will follow up with Dr. Stukowski , cardiac surgeon , in six weeks and Dr. Frehse , the patient's cardiologist in two weeks.
