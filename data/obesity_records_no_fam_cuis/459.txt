Discharge Date: 4/17/2006 ATTENDING: DEPSKY , GWYNETH MD ADDENDUM: Addendum to discharge summary , record number #3466344 which was dictated by Hatstat , Magda Teisha . 
ADDENDUM TO DISCHARGE SUMMARY: NEURO: Neurology consult was obtained for increased somnolence over the past three weeks , which was noted per the patient's son which he thinks is a change from baseline. 
Neurology consult recommended that we get an MRI/MRA of the brain with gadolinium contrast to look for leptomeningeal disease and other sources for increased somnolence which are treatable. 
They also recommended an EEG be done. 
The EEG was done and showed no seizure activity. 
The MRI/MRA was done and showed only a right MCA infarct , which was known and old with no interval change. 
Gadolinium contrast was not given because the patient became too agitated and was moving too much during the study for an effective study to be obtained. 
They also recommended that we check certain labs including folate , B12 , TSH and RPR all of which were essentially normal. 
TSH was elevated but patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is on Synthroid. 
Neurology was consulted on the day of discharge and they agreed that no further evaluation of the somnolence is necessary at this time. 
If the somnolence continues into the near future further evaluation may be necessary. 
Leptomeningeal disease is unlikely given the lack of new neurological findings , and since the patient is scheduled for a PET scan of the chest to evaluate for spread of her known lung cancer , if there is no interval change in her oncological process the likeliness of leptomeningeal disease is quite low.
