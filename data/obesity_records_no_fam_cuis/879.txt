HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient in 1/25 developed right breast cancer , stage III. 
Treatment included lumpectomy and chemotherapy. 
The patient had persistent pancytopenia , which was evaluated in 10/4 with bone marrow aspirate biopsy , which showed multiple cytogenetic abnormalities with findings consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome. 
In 8/14 , she had a nonmyeloblative peripheral blood stem cell transplant for a match unrelated donor. 
In 10/18 , she had lymphocyte infusion. 
On 5/8 , chimerism study showed 58% donor origin. 
Repeat chimerism on 8/23/05 showed 100% chimerism. 
The patient prior to admission for two weeks had diarrhea , watery in nature. 
She denied sick contacts , had GI biopsy in middle of 5/24 that showed focal colitis , without signs of GVHD. 
The patient was given prescription for steroids three days prior to admission , but did not complete or fill the prescription , was admitted from the clinic with significant skin rash that was consistent with graft versus host disease. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes breast cancer in 1/25 , myelodysplastic syndrome , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. 
The patient had isolated complicated migraine headache and has aortic valvular disease with aortic insufficiency. 
ALLERGIES: She describes no allergies to medications. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is divorced with one son , denies alcohol or illicit drug intake. 
PHYSICAL FINDINGS: On exam vital signs were stable. 
The patient had dry maculopapular rash over the upper chest and face , also including the upper extremities , abdomen , and upper thighs bilaterally , flat , slightly erythematous. 
HEENT exam was normal. 
She had dry mucous membranes. 
Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation. 
Cardiac exam: There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best in the aortic area. 
Abdomen is soft and nontender. 
There is no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated on clinical exam. 
She has large external hemorrhoids. 
There is no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
Neurological exam is nonfocal. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Oncology: The patient has a history of MDS , 11 months status post nonmyeloablative transplant. 
The patient was very slow to engraft and required donor lymphocyte infusion. 
Most recent chimerism studies on 8/23/05 showed a 100% donor origin. 
The patient had stage III skin GVH confirmed by biopsy on 6/15/05. 
She had moderate improvement response to Solu-Medrol , which was started on 8/5/05 ( switched to prednisone on 6/11/05 ) and Elidel started on 5/22/05. 
There has been even more improvement in the skin GVH since initiating rapamycin on 8/6 Gut GVH/diarrhea. 
GI biopsy done on 5/10/05 showed grade II graft versus host disease in left transverse colon , grade I graft versus host disease in rectum , with no viral cytopathic changes. 
The patient had no significant decrease in the amount of stools with Solu-Medrol , marginal response to rapamycin , now with some improvement status post three doses of ONTAK. 
ONTAK was given on 6/17/05 , 9/6/05 , and 10/22/05 without adverse events. 
The patient was premedicated with Pepcid , steroids , Benadryl , and Tylenol. 
The only side effect is marked increase in left upper extremity edema ( see cardiovascular section for more details ). 
Solu-Medrol IV was started 2 mg/kg/day , started on 8/5/05 , changed to 2 mg/kg by mouth oral steroids on 6/13/05. 
Began tapering with steroids at 100 mg b.i.d. on 11/18/05 , decreased to 80 mg on 8/20/05 , and down to 60 mg twice daily on 10/24/05. 
Rapamycin was started on 10/10/05 , goal level between 3 and 12. 
The patient has been therapeutic since initiating therapy. 
She remains on GVH diet , coordinating with dietary and kitchen for correct menu. 
She also has been on lactose-restricted diet that has helped the stool volume as well. 
2. Hematology: The patient with no active bleeding was transfused for hematocrit less than 26 and platelets less than 20. 
She did have intermittent bright red blood and clots in stool , most recently on 10/2/05 and 8/25/05. 
This was attributed to have large hemorrhoids that were found on colonoscopy. 
She remained hemodynamically stable throughout. 
3. Infectious disease: The patient remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization , maintained on prophylactic medication of Mepron and acyclovir. 
Cytomegalovirus viral load on 2/7/05 , 8/5/05 , 5/10/05 , and 10/10/05 , all negative. 
CMV viral load on 9/6/05 was pending at the time of this dictation. 
The patient is to remain on acyclovir and Mepron once transferred. 
4. Cardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stable , did not get hypotensive throughout the admission. 
5. Extremities: The patient had left upper extremity swelling , markedly worsened , starting on tacrolimus , as this is known to cause capillary leak syndrome due to an ultrasound of the left upper extremity on 11/28/05 , which is negative for DVT. 
Etiology is likely due to lymphedema secondary to axillary resection when the patient had breast cancer and capillary leak syndrome associated with ONTAK. 
The patient had an echocardiogram to assess the etiology of peripheral edema , which showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild aortic insufficiency , and aortic stenosis , borderline diastolic dysfunction , normal right heart , and minimal pericardial effusion. 
6. Pulmonary: The patient had one episode of dyspnea when speaking on 11/16/05 , which resolved without further symptoms throughout the admission. 
The patient had chest x-ray on 10/6/05 , which showed small left pleural effusion without other abnormalities. 
7. Gastrointestinal: Mouth , the patient had dry mouth , likely a component of graft versus host disease using ice chips and mouth coat is helpful to her. 
She should continue this throughout. 
8. Gut: The patient had persistent loose stools improved ( see oncology section ). 
Clostridium difficile testing sent on 8/26/05 and 3/5/05 were negative. 
She had intermittent bright red blood per rectum that was related to external hemorrhoids , as stated above in GI section. 
Colonoscopy on 5/10/05 revealed stage II GVHD on biopsy with no gross visual evidence of bleed. 
As the fact now , the patient was admitted on 7/16/05 with bright red blood. 
The colonoscopy was notable for large hemorrhagic mucosa , intubating internal hemorrhoids , and at that time biopsies were negative for graft versus host disease. 
This was on 3/5/05. 
Liver transaminitis on 8/29/05 , likely due to ONTAK would be followed as an outpatient. 
The patient also had transient LFT abnormalities when first admitted and has since resolved since discontinuing Bactrim. 
The bilirubin remained normal. 
The patient was asymptomatic. 
9. Rectum: The patient had Anusol as needed for hemorrhoids. 
She was not a candidate for surgical intervention due to immunosuppression and infection risk. 
10. 
Renal: The patient repeated increasing creatinine to 1.3. 
She maintained a level of 0.9 to 1.2 throughout the last few weeks before discharge. 
11. 
Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has marked peripheral edema. 
Diureses worked well. 
The patient was up to 18 kg above admit weight and now she is only 3 kg up from the admit weight on 10/24/05. 
She is on Lasix 40 mg twice daily by mouth. 
This is likely secondary to combination to venous insufficiency , steroids , and low albumin. 
In the setting of ONTAK , she was given albumin and Lasix three times daily , which is no longer needed now that she that would not be pursuing ONTAK therapy until an outpatient attending decides , otherwise. 
She should have a goal I/O negative to 1 to 1.5 liters a day. 
Monitor hemodynamics closely if the patient has been noted to be dehydrated. 
Encouraged ambulation and for elevation we were using Ace bandage like wraps. 
The patient had electrolytes monitored and repleaded as needed. 
Nutrition was following. 
12. Endocrine: The patient's fingerstick blood sugars were 134 and 163 , improved since steroids taper initiated. 
She remained on the sliding scale as needed , likely this is due to steroids. 
13. 
Dermatology: The patient upon admission had significant involvement of skin due to GVH greater than 80% body surface area involved. 
It is improved significantly , as the exam revealed less erythema , darkening rash , and decreased distribution. 
The patient is on GVH medication , as stated in Oncology section. 
She also came in with macerated areas under both breast and was treated with miconazole powder and had improved by the day of discharge. 
14. 
Access: The patient had double lumen Hickman catheter , which is erythematous surrounding exit site. 
The cuff has been exposed for months , although the patient has had no fevers , not tender , outpatient attending requested to keep it lying in. 
SOCIAL DISPOSITION: The patient accepted at Thoeaston Healthcare We had family meeting on 8/20/05 with all siblings and patient's son agreed on once the patient is at home , need for increased support , medication compliance , Jeana Osdoba , social worker from Setlake Caardlin County Medical Center is following Dr. Alyea DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include acyclovir , Anusol , Bactroban , prednisone 60 mg by mouth twice daily , Mepron 750 mg twice daily , Celexa , sirolimus 4 mg by mouth once daily , Caltrate , vitamin D , and Nexium , tacrolimus 1% lotion twice daily to affected skin GVHD areas , and Lasix 40 mg by mouth twice daily.
