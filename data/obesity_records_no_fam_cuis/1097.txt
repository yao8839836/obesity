PROCEDURES: Procedures for this patient included a urological procedure with placement of a ureteral stent and subsequent removal of the ureteral stent. 
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission included Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. , OxyContin 90 b.i.d. and 40 q. 2 p.m. , lisinopril 40 daily , Norvasc 5 b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 b.i.d. , Levoxyl 88 mcg , Ativan 0.5 at bedtime , Niferex 150 b.i.d. , Colace b.i.d. , lactulose 50 daily , Faslodex 250 IM q. month , Coumadin 5 daily , Zometa q. month , Fosamax 70 q. 
week , and exemestane 25 mg po daily. 
ALLERGIES: Her allergies included penicillin , which resulted in pruritus and a rash. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75-year-old woman with a history of rheumatic heart disease , status post St. Jude's mitral valve repair as well as AV and TV repair who has CHF at baseline with an EF of 40% to 45% as well as metastatic breast cancer and a recent history of hydronephrosis who initially presented with chest discomfort with exertion that resolved with rest. 
The chest pain started five days prior to admission , which is described as a 7 or 8 out of 10 associated with nausea and shortness of breath , but the patient denied any radiation of the pain , any vomiting , or any diaphoresis. 
She also said that she had PND and orthopnea at baseline and she had recently increased her number of pillows that she sleeps on , from two to three. 
Her weight had been stable with no change in diet. 
She ruled out for an MI; however , given her hydronephrosis , thought to be secondary to her metastatic cancer and her rise in creatinine , it was decided to place a ureteral stent , which was done by the Urology Service. 
However , after the stent was placed , she developed severe pain , fever , and increased white blood cell count. 
Although the fever and white blood cell count resolved , she continued to feel pain , and it was decided to remove the ureteral stent since it was not decreasing her creatinine. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her admission physical exam was notable for a blood pressure of 168/94. 
Other vitals included a temperature 97.2 , pulse 69 , respiratory rate 16 , and saturating 98% on room air. 
Her JVP was 9. She had left lower lung crackles , otherwise clear. 
She has a very loud ejection murmur , loud S1 and S2. 
She was in atrial fibrillation with a irregularly irregular heart rate with no rub and she had a 1 to 2+ edema bilaterally and she was trace guaiac positive. 
PROBLEM LIST BY SYSTEM: Heart: Ischemia: She had a negative MIBI and her A and B sets of troponins were negative , however her C set was 0.14 , which was thought to be an error. 
Her aspirin and statin were continued. 
Pump: Her EF was 35% to 40%. 
She was kept on hydralazine , Lasix , and beta-blocker , and her digoxin was stopped due to bradycardia during this admission. 
In terms of her valves , she has a St. Jude valve as well as other valve abnormalities and her INR goal was 2 to 3. She was taken off her Coumadin for her stent procedure and then bridged with heparin for a PTT goal of 60 to85. 
Her Coumadin was restarted and we waited until she was therapeutic at an INR above 2 before she was discharged. 
Rate: She is normally in atrial fibrillation. 
She developed bradycardia for several days , which was though to be a combination of some Lopressor given to her in ED when she was having her rule out as well as slightly elevated levels of digoxin. 
Her dioxin was stopped. 
Her beta-blocker was stopped and then restarted at a lower dose. 
By discharge , she was tolerating low-dose Lopressor. 
During the hospital stay , on 2/29/05 she had 10 beats of VT during which she was asymptomatic. 
Her blood pressure was stable. 
Renal: She had acute renal failure on admission and as I had dictated previously she had a ureteral stent placed on 2/29/05 and that was then removed on 2/24/05 because of her severe pain. 
Endocrine: She was kept on her Levoxyl. 
Heme: She was guaiac positive , and her stools were guaiaced and her hematocrit was monitored. 
Although it dropped initially , it did not drop further during the hospital stay. 
She was kept on her home pain control medications and she required additional pain medications when she had her stent placed. 
Psych: She continued her home medications. 
GI: She stayed on her lactulose and Colace and bowel regimen was titrated to bout BM's. 
DISPOSITION: She was stable on the day of discharge. 
She was discharged to home , I believe , with VNA. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her medications on the day of discharge were Coumadin 6 q.p.m. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20 in the morning and 40 at night , Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. , Aranesp 100 subcutaneous q. week , OxyContin 90 q. 12h. 
and 40 q.
