STATUS POST MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 45 year old gentleman with a history of a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in 23 of September He was also recently involved in a motor vehicle accident , and has had left pressure since the accident. 
His cardiac history began in 26 of September , when he suffered a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. 
A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a 90% proximal left anterior descending lesion with anterolateral akinesis , which was treated with angioplasty. 
He had a limited stress test on 18 of July , which was limited by symptoms of chest pressure. 
The electrocardiogram and thallium done at that time were both unrevealing. 
The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July , and then again in January , 1991. 
He suffered multiple contusions , but no fractures. 
Subsequent to the accidents , however , he described having left flank and left side pain , which was exacerbated by movement and was associated with the development of his left substernal chest pressure. 
Nitroglycerin did seem to provide him some relief. 
The patient was seen recently at Ley Rotal University Medical Center in Tonbalt for chest discomfort , and electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes did not show any evidence of myocardial infarction. 
The patient has continued to complain of chest discomfort over the past month , but all electrocardiograms have been negative. 
An exercise tolerance test was performed at Roose County Memorial Hospital , which was positive for chest discomfort and for ST depressions in the inferolateral leads. 
Thallium examination was not performed because of infiltration of the intravenous access. 
He was transferred from Roose County Memorial Hospital on 22 of November , for further work-up and possible cardiac catheterization. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a well nourished , well appearing young black male. 
His blood pressure was 130/80 , pulse 55 , respiratory rate 12. Lungs were clear. 
Cardiac examination revealed S1 , S2 , with an S4 present , the jugular venous pressure was 5. The patient had 2+ carotid upstrokes without bruits. 
The abdomen was soft , good bowel sounds , with left-sided tenderness and left flank tenderness to palpation. 
Extremities showed no edema and good distal pulses. 
Neurologic examination showed cranial nerves intact , motor examination showed some decreased power on the left , but this was thought secondary to pain. 
Sensory examination was normal , and his plantar reflexes were downgoing. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , potassium was 4.6 , creatinine 1.3 , ALT 155 , AST 80 , LDH 228 , creatinine kinase 79 , cholesterol 212 , triglyceride 316 , white blood count 6.1 , hematocrit 39 , prothrombin time 13.5 , partial thromboplastin time 89.4. 
Admission chest x-ray showed no abnormalities. 
Admission electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 56 beats per minute with some inverted T-waves in leads II , III , F , and V2 through V4. 
The inverted T-wave in lead II appeared to be new from a transfer electrocardiogram. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 22 of November , and was seen by the Dental Service for his atypical pain radiating to the neck. 
His cardiac risk factors included a positive family history and a smoking history of less than 1 pack per day. 
He had no history of diabetes or previous hypertension. 
The patient continued to have chest pain , which responded only to morphine. 
He underwent cardiac catheterization on 30 of April , which revealed a right dominant circulation , kinking of the proximal left anterior descending artery with a 70% stenosis. 
The patient tolerated the cardiac catheterization well without hematoma or bruit in the right groin. 
The patient continued to have episodes of chest pain with 5/10 left-sided sternal chest pain without clear electrocardiogram changes from the admission electrocardiogram. 
He underwent an exercise tolerance test which showed he had 4/10 chest pain prior to beginning the exercise tolerance test , but then got worsening chest pain during the test after 8 minutes and 15 seconds , peak heart rate 160 , blood pressure 166/40. 
He did develop 1 millimeter of downsloping ST depressions in the lateral leads , and a pseudonormalization of the T-waves. 
The results were discussed with the patient and the options were discussed , that is medical management versus a repeat angioplasty or possible surgery. 
The patient preferred medical management and wanted to be at home to see if increased medical management would stabilize his chest pain. 
The patient was discharged on 9 of September DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. 
He was to have close FOLLOW-UP and management of his cardiac disease with the Cardiology Group. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included Motrin 600 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , diltiazem 90 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , Lopressor 50 milligrams by mouth twice a day , Ecotrin 1 tablet by mouth per day , Pepcid 20 milligrams by mouth twice a day , Isordil 40 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain , and Halcion 0.25 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep. 
The patient had a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. Murelli in Bile Lum TO856/9147 MOSHE J. SHUGRUE , M.D. PJ4 D: 10/26/91 Batch: 5686 Report: A0957C71 T: 7/24/91 Dictated By: ELA M. LODEN , M.D.
