837738844 | PUO | 92204102 | | 701285 | 8/5/2001 12:00:00 AM | ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 2/14/2001 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 3/5/2001 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION. 2. LEFT FRONTAL LOBE MENINGIOMA. 3. DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Olivio is a 90+ year-old woman with a history of hypertension , prior atrial fibrillation , who presented to the Norap Valley Hospital on 2/14/01 with shortness of breath and some chest pain lasting several hours at home. 
She was brought in by her great granddaughter and found to have ST segment elevations inferiorly on an electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction. 
At that point she was transferred to Pagham University Of for emergent catheterization. 
In the emergency room she was treated with Lasix , Lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin and heparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. 
Cardiac catheterization showed a right dominant system with no left main disease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percent lesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descending coronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posterior descending coronary artery stenosis. 
The posterior descending coronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residual stenosis of 0 percent. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications and was then transferred to the intensive care unit for further monitoring. 
On admission to the coronary care unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness of breath , and no chest pain. 
She was noted to have a right groin hematoma for which pressure was held. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation , history of pulmonary edema , left frontal lobe meningioma as documented by MRI of the brain in February of 2000. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day , Zestril 10 mg per day , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure 140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 liters of oxygen. 
GENERAL: Awake , alert and oriented in no acute distress. 
Oropharynx is clear. 
Crackles present bilaterally throughout both lung fields. 
CARDIAC: Regular , rate and rhythm. 
Normal S1 and S2. II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. 
No radiation to the neck. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender and nondistended. 
Positive bowel sounds. 
EXTREMITIES: No edema. 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Neurologic status intact. 
Nonfocal exam. 
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White blood cell count 13.6 , hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000. 
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 100 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 37 , creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. 
PT was 11 , PTT 23 , INR 0.88. 
CK number one is 216 with no MB fraction done prior to transfer. 
CK number two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , MB 310 , troponin 3.49. 
Electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm at the time pre-catheterization. 
Rate of 75. 
Two millimeter ST segment elevation in leads II , III and F. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit after cardiac catheterization and right coronary artery stent for further management. 
She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. 
Her peak CK was 2577 with a MB fraction of 310. 
Troponin on admission was 3.49. 
She was placed on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Zestril and simvastatin. 
Two days after this initial catheterization on 10/10/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequently had an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be to diastolic dysfunction. 
This occurred in the context of her having a systolic blood pressure of 200. 
She was then transferred back to the coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints of chest pain. 
Electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the T waves laterally. 
Her CKs continued to trend down however due to the concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin and brought back to the catheterization laboratory on 6/27/01 for stenting of the left circumflex lesion. 
Since the second stent she continued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. 
Her CKs continued to trend down. 
An echocardiogram was done which showed an ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
She was managed with aspirin , Plavix with plans to keep her on this for one month , Zocor and Lopressor. 
Due to a rising creatinine after the second catheterization her Zestril has been stopped and she has been started on hydralazine until her creatinine normalizes. 
2. Renal: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 which increased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. 
The etiology is deemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. 
Her creatinine is now improving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. 
This should be followed and her Zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and the hydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0. 
Electrolytes were stable throughout the admission. 
3. Pulmonary: No active issues currently. 
She did have an episode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high blood pressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. 
The goal is to control the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes. 
There is no need for diuresis. 
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with a hematocrit of 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission. 
She did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. 
She was transfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 and for the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at 34. 
The patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is on Prilosec 20 mg q day. 
5. Psychiatry/neurologic: The patient was noted to sun down at night with episodes of confusion and agitation. 
A psychiatry consult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior was consistent with dementia and recommended starting Zyprexa. 
The patient was placed on standing Zyprexa 5 mg at night and continued to improve on this medication. 
She had no episodes of agitation after being transferred to the floor. 
In addition she has a history of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with a meningioma. 
This has been noted on CT and MRI scans done in February of 2000. 
Neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgery would not be a good option for this patient , in addition they did not feel that the mass was responsible for any mental status changes. 
6. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of a positive RPR which has not been treated previously. 
She is now being treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units times three injections. 
She has one injection pending which is due on 3/5/01. 
In addition she has had a negative lumbar puncture for neurologic syphilis. 
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is to be discharged to the Xi Sley Ralpi Medical Center with eventual plans to return to home. 
She will also follow up with a new primary care provider , Dr. Yelena Northey at the Barbto Be Medical Center on 2/2/01. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n. pain , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin 15 cc p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n. cough , hydralazine 20 mg p.o. q.i.d. 
Plan to stop hydralazine when creatinine returns below 2.0 and at that time Zestril 10 mg per day should be started. 
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day , penicillin benzathine 2.4 million units IM q weeks , last dose on 3/5/01. 
Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q 8 hours p.r.n. osteoarthritic pain , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q HS , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q day , Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. q h.s. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q day times 24 days.
