SERVICE: Heart Failure. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Referred by primary care physician for increased dyspnea on exertion. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old male with COPD , CABG , ischemic cardiomyopathy , hypertension , CRI , CAD , atrial fibrillation , distant history of DVT , morbid obesity , presents with three weeks of increased dyspnea on exertion despite an increase in his Lasix dose from 80 mg b.i.d. to 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
He has also had progressive fatigue and somnolence. 
He denies PND , orthopnea , chest pain , recently ( one week ago ). 
He had productive cough and was started on amoxicillin with some initial improvement in his energy , but has had a continuous decline since then. 
He can do his activities of daily living , but he gets shortness of breath when he is wheeling around in his wheelchair. 
He went to his primary care physician , Dr. Tien Rester who felt that he was volume overloaded and noticed a desaturation to 81% on room air and admitted him to the Heart Failure Service for diuresis and optimization.

20. Hemoglobin A1c on 11/29/04 was 5.6. 
ALLERGIES: Linezolid. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Lasix 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( increased from 120 mg b.i.d. on 4/13/04 ). 2. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. started on 11/9/04.

7. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day. 
The following medications have been stopped recently: 1. ACE inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ). 2. Zocor. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure 140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on 2 liters. 
The patient was in no apparent distress at rest , but had mild shortness of breath with repositioning. 
His JVP was 13 to 14 cm. 
He had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way up his lungs. 
Heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left upper sternal border murmur. 
Abdomen: Obese , nontender , nondistended , normoactive bowel sounds. 
He had a left below the knee amputation , which was warm and clean. 
Right leg was fully intact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg from the knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and no palpable pulses. 
LABORATORIES: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 30 , BUN 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. 
BNP was 473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. 
White blood cell count 6.2 , hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , INR 3.0 , PTT 68.9. 
Chest x-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiac silhouette. 
EKG left bundle-branch block with no peaked T waves , normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversion in I , L , V5 , V6 ( which represent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric , consistent with LVH although it does not meet formal LVH criteria ). 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: a. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but given his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was negative. 
b. Pump: The patient was felt to be volume overloaded. 
His admission weight was 130 kg. 
He was started on IV Lasix for diuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to 3 liters negative per day. 
He had a right heart catheterization which showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure of 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting high left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. 
Cardiac output was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , SVR was 695 , PVR was 174. 
Therefore , the patient was felt to still be volume overloaded and was diuresed further. 
At the time of this dictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 on admission. 
From the perspective of blood pressure , he was started on hydralazine and Isordil to reduce his afterload and these were titrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than 120. 
c. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kept on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 except when he was being prepped for his right heart cath. 
He is now being restarted on Coumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3. 2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possible causes for his shortness of breath including volume overload and his underlying COPD and body habitus. 
An arterial blood gas was done with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed pH of 7.28 , CO2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. 
This is on 2 liters nasal cannula giving an A-a gradient of 16. 
Compared to his prior ABG in January 2003 , which showed pH 7.43 , carbon dioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. 
This suggested that the patient was hypoventilating. 
Therefore , he was started on BiPAP overnight and he said that his sense of comfort of breathing improved following BiPAP. 
At this point , he will be sent home on home BiPAP. 3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral effusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , because the patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be improving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted. 
4. Dermatological: The patient had severe skin thickening from his lymphedema. 
Dermatology was consulted for proper care of his legs. 
They were initially concerned that there could have been a superimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on levofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant clinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin was discontinued after two days. 
Dermatology made specific recommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strength Dakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed by betamethasone cream and Lac-Hydrin cream mixture twice a day. 
There is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of the patient's nose for which Dermatology performed a shave biopsy for concern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cell carcinoma. 
This showed endophytic squamous proliferation with atypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. 
This was potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cell carcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitive diagnosis. 
Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point. 
5. Urology: The patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urine output into his Foley. 
Initially , this was dark red; however , this lightened significantly. 
There are also some clots evident. 
The Foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on his own; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although it appears to have lightened up. 
Further followup will be required likely with Urology as an outpatient. 
6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which is well controlled after his recent weight loss. 
He was maintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale. 
7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. 
We avoided contrast dye. 
The patient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresis process going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04. 
The discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as an addendum at the time of discharge.
