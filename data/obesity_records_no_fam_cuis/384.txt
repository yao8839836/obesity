OTHER TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. ) None. BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE: HPI: Ms. Sakal is a 70 yo woman with h/o Cardiac Transplant 1992 , s/p PCI/Stent 6/19 with 80% lesion LCx s/p R Carotid stent placement 6/19 , h/o DM , HTN , Hyperlipidemia , Smoking , now s/p L Carotid Stent Placement 10/24/06 .  
During annual follow up in 9/30 of her heart transplant , a complex eccentric 80% lesion was noted in the proximal LCx. 
She was admitted in January electively with plans for cardiac cath/PCI/stent. 
However in the interim period , she had a symptomatic LUE numbness thought to be a TIA , concerning for R carotid stenosis. 
An MRI revealed bilateral tight carotid stenosis. 
The LCx and Symptomatic R Carotid artery underwent cath/stent placement in 6/19 .  
However , intervention on her left internal carotid artery ( though 90% occluded by cath ) was deferred due to already receiving 2 angiographikc procedures during the 6/19 admission. 
At this time she was tapered off cell-cept and started on rapamycin - in hopes of slowing progression in her coronary disease. 
She then returned to medical attention on 19 of April for catheterization/stent placement on Left Carotid Artery. 
During these procedure , a hematoma developed at the L femoral access site which was managed with compression during the case. 
FSBS was 384 prior to the procedure and elevated to 547 during the procedure ( she received D5W+HCO3 during the procedure. 
) She was given 10 u regular insulin x 2 and her FSBS declined to 400s. 
Her post-procedure course has been complicated by hyperglycemia and hematoma formation with a Hct drop of 30 ` 22. PMH: 1.	TIA Patient taken to cath lab after RUE numbness c/w TIA 6/19 .  
Bilateral carotid stenoses were seen by angiography. 
Stenting of R internal carotid artery performed 2.	CAD: Coronary angiography/PCI of LCx lesion. 
Cypher stent. 
Discharged on ASA/Plavix. 
3.	Heart Transplant Recipient: 1992 2/2 end stage ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
Was switched from cellcept and cyclosporine to rapamycin/cyclosporine during 6/19 admission because of concern of progression of coronary disease within the allograft. 
Last Echo 1/17 LV sized decrease , normal overall function. 
EF 65%. 
No RWMA. 
RV Nl Size/thickness/function. Severe LAE/Mild RAE c/w transplant. 
No change from 10/4 study.

Extremities: Tr edema , +1 pulses DP/AT bilaterally. 
Assessment: Ms. Sakal is a 70 yo woman with h/o Cardiac Transplant 1992 , s/p PCI/Stent 6/19 with 80% lesion LCx s/p R Carotid stent placement 6/19 , h/o DM , HTN , Hyperlipidemia , Smoking , now s/p L Carotid Stent Placement 10/24/06 with postprocedure course complicated by hematoma formation causing acute on chronic anemia , and hyperglycemia. 
Labs/Studies: Chol: Chol 354 , TG 1383 , HDL 29 ( Up from 4/11 Chol 267 , TG 677 , HDL 29 ) HbA1c 11.1 ( up from 10/18 6.9 ) 1. Heme: Patient had r femoral hematoma due to bleeding around sheath and causing fluctuation in Hct. 
HCT currently stable without transfusions. 
Site non-pulsatile and no bruits. 
Transfusing 1 U pRBC 6/20 for goal Hct&gt;28. 
2. CV( Ischemia ): Patient h/o ischemic CM s/p heart transplant with evidence of CAD on allograft. 
Patient medically managed with pravachol , aspirin and plavix. 
Now s/p bilateral carotid stents and stent to LCx. Attempt to change immunosuppressive regiments to rapamycin in order to lower progression of CAD however on this regiment , her cholesterol panel has markedly worsened. 
Have stopped rapamycin ( 6/20 ) and restarting cellcept and cyclosporine at prior doses. 
Will need review in clinic in 30 days with bilateral carotid ultrasounds. 
CV( Pump ): Clinically appears euvolemic. 
On Toprol , restarting lasix at home dose ( 5/13 ). 
CV( Rhythm ): On telemetry , no events seen. 
3. Endo: During hospitalization and prior/during procedures has had poor glucose controls with FSBS in 300s-400s. 
Patient reports poor glycemic control at home with FSBS in 300s. 
AM FSBS was 384 and received D5NS prior to procedure , exacerbating hyperglycemia. 
Endocrinconsulted and recommended Qday lantus injection with with Novolog sliding scale + AC while in house. 
HbA1c @ 11 ( markedly worse than 6 in January ) - patient can not identify other factors which have changed since January other than immunosuppressants to rapamycin. 
FSBS were difficult to control in house despite using 20 QDay of lantus , Ms. Weissgerber FSBS continued to run in the 200s-300s during the day. 
She was taught to inject herself with insulin SC during her stay. 
She is discharged on Glyburide 10 QDay and Lantus 20 QDay. 
She was taught to keep a diary and will follow up with her PCP. 4. Neuro: TIA/CVA in 6/19 .  
residual Left numbness/weakness in hand. 
On plavix and asa , now s/p R and L Carotid Stents. 5. Immunosuppression: As above , have changed immunosuppression from Rapamycin + Cyclosporine back to Cyclosporine 75 BID +Cellcept 1000 BID as patient performed priorto 6/19 .  
6. MSK/Rheum: The patient previously complained of myalgias with statins and was resistant to starting statins because they seemed to worsen her aches/pains. 
Rheumatology service was consulted. 
They believed her pain is not consistent with statin associated myalgia. 
Zetia was stopped and she was started on Pravachol 20 mg QHS. 
Her back pain is relieved by leaning forward and she walks at Rham with a shopping cart for exercise which is consistent with spinal stenosis. 
They recommended physical therapy and MRI imaging of her back. 
The MRI preliminary read shows multilevel degenerative disc disease and moderate spinal stenosis at one level. 
Physical therapy saw her and thought she would benefit from home PT in the future--she was given a prescription for outpatient physical therapy. 
Since she is on long term prednisone she should have a DEXA scan and may benefit from bisphosphonate therapy.
