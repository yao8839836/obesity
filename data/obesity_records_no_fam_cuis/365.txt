Hospital Course: 1. Dyspnea: The differential diagnosis for this patient's dyspnea includes cardiac and pulmonary causes. 
Based on physical exam it was not felt that she was in heart failure. 
However , with hx of CAD , this was investigated with Echo which showd nl EF and heart function. 
The Echo also showed nl RV fxn and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. 
Chronic PE and lung parechymal diseases were investigated with chest CT which was negative for PE. 
It also showed moderate to severe centrilobular emphysema with no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. 
She had PFTs the day of admission which showed decreased lung volumes all consistent with a restrictive lung pattern.
