OTHER DIAGNOSIS: ORAL HERPES. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old man with a longstanding history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure who was originally admitted on 30 of March with worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion for augmentation of cardiac function. 
He was well until l96l when he initially presented with left bundle-branch block , left ventricular hypertrophy , and transient chest pain. 
He then had high grade ventricular ectopic activity in l972 treated with Quinaglute. 
Subsequently from l972 to l988 , examination was notable for worsening left ventricular function. 
In l988 , he had recurrent frequent congestive heart failure and underwent cardiac catheterization which showed an enlarged hypokinetic ventricle with an ejection fraction of around 32%. 
His coronary arteries showed acute marginal of 70% stenosis and 40% of the mid circumflex. 
In 1/5 , his ejection fraction by right ventriculogram was 20%. 
In 2/8 , he had atypical pneumonia followed by recurrent congestive heart failure. 
Subsequent course was notable for dyspnea on exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. 
He was treated with Lasix , Zaroxolyn , Captopril , and Quinaglute. 
In March , he was admitted to the Pagham University Of for worsening symptoms , weight gain , and creatinine of 2.9. 
He was managed with decreased Lasix , increased Captopril , and ultimately decided to treate with Lasix and Zaroxolyn. 
He was then placed on the Cardiac Transplant List and underwent transplant evaluation. 
Exercise tolerance test showed 8 minutes and 43 seconds bicycle with O2 uptake of l2. 
Right heart catheterization showed wedge pressure of 25. 
PPD was negative and abdominal ultrasound was negative. 
Echo showed global left ventricular dysfunction , apical thrombus , mild tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral regurgitation. 
Cholesterol was l53 , l-2 immunoglobulins within normal limits , and toxo was plus IgG and minus IgM. 
He had negative hepatitis , histo , blasto , or coccidiomycosis. 
CMV showed borderline IgG and negative IgM and EBV showed positive IgG and negative IgM. 
Since his discharge in August , he has noted worsening of symptoms with decreased exercise tolerance and increased orthopnea. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ended up being started on Dobutamine and had gradually declining course during his admission culminating in having a cardiac transplant when a heart became available. 
This occurred on 10/9/9l. 
His post-operative course was uncomplicated and his subsequent course was complicated only by acute worsening of his renal function associated with high Cyclosporin levels with the Cyclosporin held and the level allowed to come down. 
His renal function returned to baseline. 
He also developed an oral herpes lesion. 
He subsequently did very well post-operatively. 
Multiple right ventricular biopsies were negative for rejection. 
On biopsy on 11/21 , his wedge pressure was l8 , right atrial pressure l3 , right ventricular 48/l4 , and PA pressure of 48/24. 
He tolerated slow taper of his steroids without event and it was noted that he had some tremor also post-operatively which was attributed to Cyclosporin toxicity. 
Other than that , his post-operative course was uncomplicated. 
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home on 1/13/9l. 
He is to have follow-up with Dr. Lyn as well as Dr. Paparello DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Persantine 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Clotrimazole Troche one p.o. q.i.d. , Bactrim DS one p.o. q.o.d. , Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q.d. , Cyclosporin l50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Carafate one gram p.o. q.i.d. , Prednisone taper per the Transplant Team , Imuran 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Restoril l5 to 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Acyclovir Ointment 5% to lip six times per day. 
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
