The patient's history also is notable for severe depression and anxiety. 
He had been fine with medical management of his coronary artery disease until three to four months prior to admission when he began feeling tightness in the chest and midsternal chest pain on admission. 
A stress test performed in October showed abnormalities in the septal and apical segments and an ejection fraction of 60%. 
During the last several months , the patient experienced increasing frequency of his anginal episodes and on 11/4/05 he was admitted to Pagham University Of because of complaints of chest pain and high blood pressure up to 230/130. 
The patient did experience relief with sublingual nitroglycerin. 
His EKG showed changes positive for ischemia and a troponin leak of 0.15. 
He was scheduled for cardiac catheterization performed on 9/23/05 , which revealed left main coronary artery stenosis , LAD stenosis , and a long RCA stenosis. 
The patient was then referred for surgical revascularization of his coronary arteries. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus treated with diet , hypercholesterolemia , COPD , asthma , ruptured disk x2 at age 20 , GERD , depression with three recent hospitalizations.

White blood cell count 5 , hemoglobin 12.5 , hematocrit 38.1 , platelets 165. 
PT 14.1 , INR 1 , PTT 37.7. 
Urinalysis was normal. 
Cardiac catheterization performed on 9/23/05 at Pagham University Of 90% proximal left main , 100% proximal LAD , 85% ostial OM-1 , 75% RCA with right dominant circulation. 
EKG on 2/21/05 showed normal sinus rhythm at 79 with a left bundle branch block. 
Chest x-ray on 2/21/05 was normal. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac catheterization was performed on 9/23/05 which revealed critical coronary artery disease and the patient was referred for immediate surgery. 
The following morning , the patient was brought to the operating room where Dr. Colasamte performed a CABG x5 using a LIMA to the LAD and sequential graft connecting the aorta to the acute marginal and then the PDA using saphenous vein graft. 
A second saphenous vein graft connected the aorta to the OMA-1 and then the OM-2. 
The aortic cross-clamp time was 68 minutes and the total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 119 minutes. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred postoperatively to the Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. 
On postoperatively day 1 , the patient was extubated , he was found to be anxious and the psychiatric medications were restarted. 
By postoperative day 2 , the patient complained of pain , which was highly related to anxiety. 
The patient had borderline hypotension , which responded well to fluid. 
By the third day after surgery , the patient had remained hemodynamically stable and was ready for transfer to the Step-Down Unit for the remainder of his recovery. 
The patient's chest tubes and pacer wires were removed and a follow-up chest x-ray showed no pleural effusion , pneumothoraces , and only minimal pulmonary congestion , which responded well to diuretics. 
The patient's postoperative EKGs showed a bundle-branch block that had existed preoperatively and his cardiologist advised that the patient could continue a beta-blocker as tolerated. 
During the last several days of his hospital stay , the patient required a lot of reassurance regarding his excellent recovery. 
He was ambulating comfortably in the hallways and had remained in the sinus rhythm with rate in the 70s and stable blood pressure. 
A repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of any pulmonary congestion. 
By postoperative day 7 , the patient was ready for discharge home with his wife who is a nurse. 
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: On the day of discharge , the patient's vital signs were as follows: Temperature 97.3 degrees , heart rate 84 and sinus rhythm , blood pressure 126/70 , respiratory rate 20 , and the patient was oxygenating well on room air.
