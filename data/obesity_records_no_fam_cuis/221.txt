Discharge Date: 1/6/2001 ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. 
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ATRIAL FIBRILLATION OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: Hypertension , non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , and coronary artery disease. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59-year-old italian speaking male with multiple cardiac risk factors and extensive cardiac history including a long-standing history of hypertension , non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus since 1995 with hemoglobin AIC of 10.5 on 11/16/01 , 20 pack year smoking history and family history significant for MI in his brothers at age 46 and 50 and history of hyperlipidemia. 
The patient had his first MI in 1990 complicated by congestive heart failure. 
An echocardiogram at an outside hospital revealed EF of 22% with a dyskinetic apex and a dilated left atrium. 
In August of 1995 , he had another MI , was hospitalized at I Warho Hospital where he required intubation secondary to pulmonary edema. 
In April of 1995 , he was admitted again for congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of 25 to 30% , anterior and anterolateral hypokinesis , moderate inferior and mild septal hypokinesis and mild MR. Cath. in 1995 showed three vessel disease and the patient underwent four vessel CABG in October of 1996 with saphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM1 and OM3 and a LIMA to the LAD. 
During the surgery , the patient had an ICG placed prophylactically as part of the CABG patch study. 
Since the surgery , he has had additional episodes of congestive heart failure with report of a hospitalization in September 2000 in Otte The patient reports he was hospitalized at that time for difficulty breathing and a third MI. He required intubation during this hospitalization and the course apparently was complicated by renal failure. 
Since September 2000 , the patient has reportedly felt well with no difficulty breathing or chest pain. 
More recently , two months prior to admission , the patient was found to have atrial flutter. 
He was started on 80 mg of sotalol and his arrhythmia spontaneously converted. 
Today , the patient presented to his electrophysiologist , Dr. Dominguez for routine interrogation of his pacemaker and was found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate in the 120s. 
Additionally , the patient reports worsening lower extremity edema bilaterally for the past six days and decreased urine output. 
The patient denies chest pain , shortness of breath. 
He has had no palpitations , diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting. 
He denies dietary indiscretion or any medication changes. 
He has had no fever , dysuria or cough. 
He has stable two pillow orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion but no paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
His most recent echocardiogram was in September of 2000 which showed a dilated left ventricle with EF of 15 to 20% and global hypokinesis. 
The right ventricle was moderately enlarged with depressed function. 
He had a thickened aortic valve and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. 
He had mild MR with an enlarged left atrium at 5.7 cm. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated , hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia , coronary disease and congestive heart failure. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg q. day , Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q. day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. h.s. , folate 1 mg p.o. q. day , and Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day. 
Of note , upon further questioning , it turns out the patient had been taking amiodarone and had only been started on sotalol briefly but became hypotensive with that and so he was switched to amiodarone. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 20 pack year history of smoking and currently continues with binge drinking of greater than four whiskey drinks at a time. 
He lives in Ran with his wife and children and he has not had work since his CABG.

ADMISSION LABORATORY: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 34 , creatinine 1.8 and glucose of 146 , calcium of 10.2. White blood cell count is 6.5 , hematocrit 44.6. 
Platelets 181. 
INR is 1.7.

ALT is 16 , AST 34 , alkaline phosphatase 100 , CK 181 , T. bili. 
1.7 , total protein 8 , albumin 4.7. 
EKG shows an irregular rhythm , atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 100 to 110 , no LDH , no RVH , and no acute ST , T wave. 
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , small pleural effusion , and pulmonary vascular distribution and mild interstitial edema. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to cardiology service for rate control and diuresis. 
He remained in atrial fibrillation throughout the hospital course with rates between 60 and 100. 
His Digoxin was continued and a low dose of Lopressor 6.25 b.i.d. was started for rate control. 
The patient ruled out for MI with CKs of 18 and 124 and Troponin of 0.06.

This was similar to an echocardiogram from September of 2000. 
The patient will follow-up with Dr. Rossie K Mankoski on July and Dr. Rossie Mankoski on November for consideration of electrical cardioversion. 
He will also continue on oral Lasix , Zaroxolyn and Coumadin as well as his previously stated outpatient medications.
