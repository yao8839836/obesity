For full operative details , please refer to the operative note. 
Immediately after transferring the patient to an ICU bed from the OR table , the patient went into a VFib arrest. 
CPCR was briefly performed until we could charge the external defibrillator. 
A single shot of 125 joules lidocaine 60 mg resulted in sinus rhythm and stabilization of hemodynamics.
