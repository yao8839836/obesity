PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Congestive heart failure. 
2. Diastolic dysfunction. 
3. Hypertension. 
4. Diabetes mellitus. 
5. Serratia UTI. 6. Chronic renal dysfunction. 
7. Dyslipidemia. 
8. Coronary artery disease. 
9. Mild pulmonary hypertension. 
10. 
Mitral regurgitation. 
ALLERGIES: Penicillins. 
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents with shortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for approximately three weeks. 
He has a history of coronary artery disease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequently placed five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) , hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. 
He is presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea , and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness without radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent. 
He presents after coming to an outside hospital with three to four days of these worsening symptoms. 
He was transferred to Pagham University Of where he received most of his cardiac care. 
The patient had these worsening heart failure symptoms after a trip to Tempe Leah Cu , some dietary indiscretion and a five-pound weight gain. 
He has had no syncope , palpitations , but has had some mild nausea without emesis. 
At the outside hospital when he presented , his EKG showed a baseline left bundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. 
He was given some Lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed an ejection fraction of 35%. 
He was transferred to Pagham University Of , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as a heparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior wall distal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. 
This is consistent with an echocardiogram that he received in 1/8 . 
Upon presentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 , blood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasal canula. 
His jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. 
His lungs had rales bilaterally , approximately half way up. 
He had no dullness. 
His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the left axilla. 
He had no S3 , and no S4. 
His abdomen was mildly distended. 
He had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. 
His extremities were warm. 
He had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. 
EKG at Pagham University Of revealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch pattern and no significant ST wave changes and an occasional PVC. 
ADMISSION LABORATORIES: Significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a BUN of 76 , potassium of 5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and PT-T was 56 on heparin drip. 
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Ischemia. 
The patient has an extensive history of coronary artery disease. 
He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dose beta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin. 
He initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt as demand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. 
His enzymes trended down and were negative after the initial check. 
Eventually , the patient received 48 hours of intravenous heparin as well as IV nitroglycerin and was chest pain free. 
At this point , he received an Adenosine MIBI nuclear study , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with a very small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that was felt to be nonrevascularizable. 
He was maintained on optimum medical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterization in this gentleman who had already had previous history of renal dysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye load was not warranted nor indicated at this time. 
By discharge , he was ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. 
Coronary artery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his CHF exacerbation. 
2. Pump. 
The patient had an ejection fraction of 45% upon admission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. 
He was initially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination of Lasix and Natrecor. 
At this point , his pulmonary edema had resolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. 
Given the fact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid further diuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what his right and left heart filling pressures were. 
The patient was taken to the Cardiovascular Diagnostic Laboratory and received a right heart catheterization. 
His pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary artery pressure 56/18. 
His RA pressure was 8. There was some initial false elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath lab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailored therapy to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a pulmonary artery catheter in place. 
At this point , his after-load reduction was maximized with combination of hydralazine and Isordil with good effect. 
His creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to 2.7. 
His symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2 liters of the patient. 
By discharge , the patient was actually becoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , a calcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. 
Of note , the patient has been exposed to ACE inhibition in the past and is currently not on an ACE inhibitor. 
In the past , he had had a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ACE inhibition. 
On an outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have a trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction and neurohormonal activation with his heart failure. 
The patient's heart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol , Isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic improvement. 
3. Rhythm. 
The patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. 
He was maintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. 
His electrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker. 
He had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia less than 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. 
The patient is not at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricular pacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if his QRS interval is greater than 150 ms. 4. Pulmonary. 
Given the fact that the patient had a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary artery pressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal disease was undertaken. 
He had a high resolution chest CT , which showed mild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent with pulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. 
He also had pulmonary function tests. 
Pulmonary function tests revealed an FVC of 1.88 liters and an FEV1 of 1.33 liters. 
This gives an FEV1 to FVC percent of 71%. 
He has both decreased FVC and FEV1 , but an FEV1 and FVC percent that is most consistent with a mild restriction. 
His lung volumes are approximately 50% predicted suggestive of a restrictive process and his DLCO both corrected and uncorrected are 50% predicted. 
His corrected DLCO is 13.5. 
It is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lung disease given the absence of definitive interstitial process on high resolution chest CT. 
A more likely explanation for these findings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate diuresis with his congestive heart failure. 
The patient was sating 98% on room air at the time of discharge. 
5. Endocrine. 
The patient has very difficult to control diabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both NPH and Lispro sliding scale while in house. 
He was briefly hypoglycemic during his initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection. 
This resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding his long-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy. 
He was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of NPH in the a.m. and p.m. respectively as well as a Lispro scale at the time of discharge. 
Furthermore , the patient was found to have a TSH of 0.219 as well as a normal T4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism , which is consistent with over replacement with Synthroid such as maintenance Synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcg and we recommend a TSH to be checked in late February 2004. 
6. Renal. 
The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency presumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. 
He has had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a creatinine bump to nearly 7. We wanted to avoid as much contrast dye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renal insufficiency. 
We ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three times weekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19. 
His creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge and his BUN was 67. 
He was making good urine and had no evidence of residual urinary tract infection. 
7. Infectious disease. 
Upon presentation , the patient after a Foley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic. 
Urine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of Serratia marcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosed levofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms. 
8. Neuropsych. 
The patient has a history of depression and had some mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection , which resolved with p.r.n. 
Zyprexa as well as treating of the underlying condition. 
Psychiatric Service was consulted and felt like he had a resolving medical delirium and there is no indication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at this time. 
( His mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributed to his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman of this age is not uncommon. 
) 9. Prophylaxis. 
The patient was maintained on Nexium for GI prophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. 
CODE STATUS: The patient is full code. 
The patient was consulted by both Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy who felt that acute rehabilitation would be warranted at this time.
