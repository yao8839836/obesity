On am of admission , pt was unresponsive , CPR initiated , and pt had spontaneous return of vital signs. 
Of note , an AED placed on her and determined pt did not have shockable rhythm. 
AED unfortunately did not print any strips , so we have no record of the incident. 
MD at Bea Duna Medical Center reports pt was cyanotic , apenic , with no carotid or raidal pulses , and had no heart sounds by cardiac auscultation. 
MD reports patient's skin color improved significantly with initiation of adequate bag mask ventilation. 
Whiel pt being moved from chair to ground , pt's HD access was lost. 
Pt asymptomatic on transfer , and in ER. ---- PMH: Coronary artery disease , CHF , echo in July of 1999 shows moderate left ventricular hypertrophy of about 65% , diabetes type 2 20 years including with retinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathic pain , ypertension for the past 20 years , hypercholesterolemia , s/p medullary CVA July 1999 , right PICA resulting Wallenberg's syndrome , morbid obesity , left knee degenerative joint disease , iron-deficiency anemia.

enlarged RV , mild LAE , nl RA , trave MR&lt; mild TR , no change from prior study in 8/18 EKG: rhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute ST changes and old T-wave inversion in V2. ---------- PET perfusion stress test 1/17/06 :Image quality was excellent. 
The images demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs. 
They also demonstrated a mildly dilated RV with normal RV tracer uptake at rest. 
There were no regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or rest images. 
normal perfusion , LVEF 72% , moderate RVH CXR 3/22/06 : PA and lateral films of the chest demonstrate right central line at SVC. 
There are degenerative changes of the dorsal spine. 
The heart is not enlarged. 
There are no acute infiltrates or effusions. 
-------------- PROCEDURE: 10/7/06 : EP study revealed normal SA node functino , normal conduction , and no tachyarrythmias were stimulated. 
An implanted loop recorder device , the Medtronic Reveal Plus , was plced in patient's chest. 
Pt tolerated procedure with no complications , bleeding or signs/sx of infection.

However , given this is the second presentation , a proper arrhythmia evaluation was warranted. 
The pt's differential included arrythmia vs obesity hypoventilation ( pt reports OSA sx ) , hypoglycemia , and HD-related hypotension. 
Ischemia ) serial cardiac enzymes negative. 
Pt was continued on asa , bb , and placed on statin and NTG prn while ruling out ischemic heart disease in anticipation of possible EP study. 
PET perfusion scan for reversible ischemia was negative , showing normal perfusion. 
Pump: JVP not appreciated , decreased LE edema relative to prior admission. 
pt was continued home dose diuretic , and kept on a BB , CCB , and her ACEi to goal SBP&lt;120. 
Rhythm: Pt was placed on telemetry to monitor for arrythmia while on floor. 
No events were noted , but given history , pt was taken to cath lab for EP study on 4/19/06. 
EPS showed normal conduction , normal SA node , and so a loop recorder device was implanted , which will monitor pt's HR and record if HR&gt; or &lt; parameters , or if pt triggers device to record. 
No signs/sx of bleeding , infectino , hematoma. 
Pt discharged on 3 day course of Keflex , to be given after HD. RENAL: ESRD on HD. Pt HD on Wed and Sat am of admission , which she tolerated with no difficulty. 
Pt was continued on EPO 10 , 000U qHD. 
Pt has tunneled line in Right IJ for access. 
HEME: Anemia: in setting of ESRD , baseline Hct around 30. 
Pt on epogen. 
Anemia studies WNL. 
ENDO: Diabetes type 2: Long and short-acting SC insulin. 
BID NPH started at lower than home dose while oral diet is held , with lower sliding scales , due to significant parts os stay where pt was NPO for procedures.

ID: pt reports 4 day h/o productive cough prior to admission. 
Pt afebrile , but on HD6 , pt has eleavtion in WBC ( 6.9--&gt;12 ) , however pt afebrile , asymptomatic , CXR shows no infiltrative process , and in setting of recent procedure.
