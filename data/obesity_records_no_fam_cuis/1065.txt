Carotid imaging: Left and right internal carotid arteries , both with 0% occlusion. 
Cardiac catheterization performed at Pagham University Of on 10/18/06 showed stenosis in the following coronary arteries: 70% proximal PDA , 90% proximal LAD , 70% mid circumflex with right dominant circulation. 
Ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 35%. 
EKG on 4/5/06 showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63. 
There was poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads and inverted T waves in leads III , V5 and V6. Chest x-ray on 4/5/06 was consistent with congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette. 
There is mild CHF , bilateral atelectasis. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on the day prior to her scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup. 
On 5/26/06 , she was brought to the operating room where Dr. Kertesz performed a CABG x3 using the LIMA to bypass the LAD and saphenous vein graft to bypass the OM1 and saphenous vein graft to bypass the PDA. 
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107 minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. 
The vein was harvested from both legs. 
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit after her surgery where she remained intubated for two days due to poor lung compliance. 
She was also hypotensive in the postoperative period and treated with vasoactive medications. 
By postoperative day #2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable , however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and her Lopressor was increased. 
By post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillation was rate controlled and she was started on Coumadin. 
By postoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the ICU to the Step-Down Unit. 
At that point , she was neurologically intact and her pain was well controlled. 
She was being treated with beta-blockers and Coumadin for AFib. 
From a respiratory perspective , the patient was being treated with aggressive pulmonary toilet and chest PT. 
Her chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. 
The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output. 
The patient was treated with Lasix for postoperative fluid retention. 
She also was seen by the Diabetes Management Service throughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control. 
On the step-down Unit on postoperative day #5 , the patient experienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 and she became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after her diltiazem was increased. 
She was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit where she was observed for three more days. 
During that time , the patient's hemodynamics stabilized although she remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. 
On postoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to the Step-Down Unit where she spent the remaining six days of her hospital stay. 
The patient's chest x-ray suggested that she was volume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated with Lasix and Zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowly from 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. 
The diuretics were decreased. 
A chest ultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesis revealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis and minimal effusion. 
The focus then became on chest PT , pulmonary toilet and deep breathing and coughing. 
The patient continued to ambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , the patient's chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis in the right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements. 
From a cardiac perspective in the Step-Down Unit , the patient was in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11 and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for the final three days of her hospital stay. 
The patient had been started on Coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation and this medication should continue at least until she follow up with a cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heart rhythm. 
By postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinus rhythm with a stable blood pressure. 
She was oxygenating well on room air and was ambulating effectively on her own. 
She had no complaints and was ready for discharge to home. 
On that day , her temperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm , blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 saturation 94% on room air. 
The patient was seven kilograms below her preoperative weight. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. 
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with VNA Services. 
DISCHARGE DIET: A low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat 2100 calorie per day , 4 gm sodium per day diet.

She should also see Ross Allegrini , NP in the diabetes Clinic in one to two weeks. 
Her phone number is 919-088-7001 tyhgphlkk 1. Finally , the patient should see her cardiac surgeon , Dr. Aleta Kertesz at 117-219-4079 in four to six weeks.
