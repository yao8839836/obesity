Discharge Date: 10/3/1995 DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: ( 1 ) GASTRIC REFLUX DISEASE ( 2 ) HYPERTENSION , 15 YEARS ( 3 ) ADULT ONSET DIABETES MELLITUS , NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT , 1 - 2 YEARS ( 4 ) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA , TREATED FOR 4 YEARS ( 5 ) HISTORY OF MYOCARDITIS ( 6 ) STATUS POST TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY/BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY IN 1975 WITHOUT ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT ( 7 ) HISTORY OF DEPRESSION ( 8 ) MULTIPLE FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL ALLERGIES HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 57 year old woman with cardiac risk factors with complaint of substernal chest pain relieved by two sublingual nitroglycerins. 
Cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use in the past , hypercholesterolemia , and early menopause with no estrogen replacement. 
She was admitted on 11/10/95 with complaint of chest pain at rest without associated symptoms. 
There was no complaint of decreased exercise tolerance , exertional symptoms. 
No PND , edema , nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis at this time. 
The complaint at that time was 3 out of 10 chest pressure which spontaneously resolved. 
It recurred intermittently without associated symptoms , no EKG changes. 
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and EKG. 
CKs were 156 , 135 , and 108. 
She was treated with aspirin , beta blockers , and nitroglycerin. 
The concern was for a question of unequal blood pressures in the patient and complaint of back pain. 
A GEE was done to rule out aortic dissection. 
On GEE there were no valvular abnormalities or evidence for dissection and no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
ETT was done on 8/26/95 .  
The patient exercised for 4 minutes 13 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol. 
She was stopped secondary to leg fatigue and dyspnea with a heart rate of 84 - 113 with a target of 138. 
Blood pressure was 136/80 and elevated to 164/90. 
There were no EKG changes and no evidence for ischemia on this study despite limited effort. 
On the evening of admission on 7/25/95 she again had the acute onset of sharp , burning , mid-epigastric versus sternal pain without radiation and with associated shortness of breath , diaphoresis , nausea , and an acid taste. 
She took two sublingual nitroglycerins with relief of symptoms. 
The pain lasted a total of 15 minutes. 
She has been pain-free since arrival to the hospital. 
MEDICATIONS: Glucotrol 20 mg q.d. , Cardizem CD , Benadryl 50 mg t.i.d. , Provastatin 20 mg q.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg q.d. , Trazadone 50 mg q.h.s. , aspirin 1 q.d. , Lopressor 75 mg q.d. , nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. , Ambien 5 mg q.h.s. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a receptionist. 
She has three children. 
She has never married. 
She lives alone. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile with blood pressure of 132/96 , pulse 95. 
She was on one liter of oxygen , saturation of 97%. 
Respiratory rate was 20. HEENT: Normal. 
No JVD. 
Lungs were clear. 
Heart: PMI was nondisplaced. 
Normal S1 and S2. No S3 or S4. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs. 
Abdomen: Soft but obese. 
Nontender , nondistended. 
No hepatojugular reflux. 
No abdominal bruits. 
No pulsatile masses. 
Extremities: Without edema , cords , or femoral bruits. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable for potassium of 3.7 , magnesium 1.9. 
Hematocrit 36 , WBC 11.5. 
CK first set was 118. 
Triponin was 0.0. 
EKG was notable for normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs. 
Intervals and axis were within normal limits. 
There was a slight upper concavity and ST-T segment in V2 and V3 when compared to old although this could be consistent with J point elevation and a question of a 0.5 mm segment elevation in V2. 
The EKG was without change from previous admission. 
IMPRESSION: This is a 57 year old woman with multiple cardiac risk factors presenting with complaint of substernal , midepigastric pain , burning. 
Although she had multiple cardiac risk factors , her pain is of an atypical quality and sounds more consistent with a gastrointestinal source. 
The GEE was a suboptimal study and it was deemed more appropriate on admission to both rule the patient out but consider a pharmacologic stress test before cathing this patient. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Since the patient's symptoms did sound more gastrointestinal , she was started on Axid for possibility of gastroesophageal reflux disease , as well as provided with Maalox and told to keep the head of the bed elevated. 
She was continued on Glucotrol for diabetes mellitus and was instructed on risk factor modifications , including diabetes mellitus control , controlling cholesterol and hypertension. 
She is currently a non-smoker. 
On the day following admission the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzyme sets respectively. 
A set was 118; B set was 105; C set was 105; D set was 100. 
EKGs were without change. 
As well , the patient had remained symptom-free during the hospital course and was scheduled for a Dobutamine MIBI for 6/23/95 .  
The patient on Dobutamine MIBI study showed heart rate going up from 70 to 101 , blood pressure 170/80 went up to 230/90. 
There were no EKG changes and no chest pressure. 
MIBI images were notable for a fixed mild reduced uptake in the inferior wall consistent with but not diagnostic for myocardial injury. 
There were no reversible perfusion abnormalities detected. 
As such the patient was discharged home with a change in her medication regimen. 
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. , Ecasa 325 mg q.d. , Glucotrol 20 mg b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Trazadone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Axid 150 mg p.o. q.d. , Provastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. 
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Oaxaca as an outpatient for further workup and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease , as well as following her for her cardiac disease via the risk factor modification.
