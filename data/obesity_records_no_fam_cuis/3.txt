ALLERGIES: Lisinopril leads to cough and metformin leads to GI distress. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was formerly employed as a cashier. 
She has two children. 
She is a former cigarette smoker. 
She does not use alcohol. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/ PROBLEM: Persistent pulmonary 1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure. 
On 1/7/06 , shortly after her admission to the medical floor , the patient was noted to be in respiratory distress with tachypnea , accessory muscle use and oxygen saturation of 68% on 6 liters nasal cannula. 
She was placed on a nonrebreather. 
Her oxygen saturation increased to 93%; however , she continued to be in respiratory distress with tachypnea and accessory muscle use. 
She was intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and management. 
Her respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to pneumonia with a component of superimposed volume overload. 
She was treated with a 10-day course of vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime as well as with IV Lasix. 
She underwent a code green on 7/30/06 during an ETT tube change , wherein a patent airway was transiently loss. 
The patient was slow to wean from the ventilator. 
Her chest imaging revealed persistent bilateral opacifications. 
It was thought that after an initial infectious insult , the patient developed ARDS. 
On 9/14/06 , the patient underwent bronchoscopy and BAL revealing MRSA and HSV. 
The patient was treated with a 10-day course of acyclovir for presumed HSV tracheobronchitis. 
Given her inability to be weaned from the vent , the patient underwent a tracheostomy on 4/17/06 .  
Post-tracheostomy , the patient alternated between pressure support ventilation with low driving pressure and PEEP with a trach collar.. Infectious disease: 1. Fevers. 
From 1/7/06 to 7/28/06 , the patient was treated with vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime for hospital acquired pneumonia. 
After discontinuation of her antibiotics , the patient continued to spike fevers and evidence of leukocytosis. 
In verification into source of her fevers included serial blood cultures , urine cultures and C-dif. 
Positive data included: 7/28/06 , urine culture with yeast , 7/28/06 , blood culture with coag-negative staph , 9/14/06 BAL washings with HSV , 9/14/06 , blood culture with coag-negative staph , 7/11/06 , blood culture with coag-negative staph , 2/29/06 , urine culture with yeast , 2/29/06 BAL washings with MRSA , 10/28/06 urine with yeast urine with yeast , 10/28/06 , 6/23/06 , 4/17/06 , and 10/11/06 sputum with MRSA. 
7/28/06 , chest CT with bilateral opacification in the lung parenchyma. 
2/29/06 facial CT with left sphenoid maxillary thickening. 
2/29/06 chest CT with bilateral opacification in the lung parenchyma. 
Of note , a 2/29/06 abdominal CT showed no evidence of abdominal infection , 2/29/06 TTE showed no obvious vegetations , and 10/11/06 tap of the right knee grew no organisms. 
In light of the data above , the patient's indwelling catheters were changed. 
She underwent treatment with linezolid x7 days for MRSA line infection. 
She also underwent treatment with acyclovir x10 days for HSV tracheobronchitis. 
The aforementioned antibiosis was mostly prophylactic. 
It was thought that the patient's intermittent fevers were not infectious , but rather reflected a drug allergy , most likely to vancomycin. 
This hypothesis was supported by a robust eosinophilia coinciding with vancomycin administration. 
Shortly after vancomycin discontinuation , the patient's fevers resolved. 
The patient was afebrile for greater than 48 hours off all antibiotics prior to transfer to rehabilitation. 
Cardiovascular: 1. Volume status. 
The patient's admission weight was 106.2 kg. 
It is unclear what her dry weight was. 
Given that pulmonary edema was thought to be contributing to the patient's slow ventilator wean , she was diuresed with a combination of Lasix and Diuril followed by combinations of torsemide and Diuril. 
Her discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. 
Her diuretic regimen on discharge with torsemide 100 mg IV t.i.d. and Diuril 500 mg IV t.i.d. 
The patient's diuretic regimen will need be adjusted as her intake is adjusted. 
Her creatinine will need to be monitored very closely. 
Her weight will need to be checked daily. 
2. Pump: The patient underwent echocardiogram on 11/19/06 , 7/17/06 , and 2/29/06 .  
On the whole , these studies revealed an ejection fraction of 45-50% , concentric LVH , global hypokinesis with regional variation , mild left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , a question of mild atrial stenosis , and pulmonary artery pressures in the 40s. 
For her heart failure , the patient was treated with Lopressor and diuretics as above. 
She was not started on an ACE inhibitor given her allergy ( cough ). 
She was started on low-dose ARB. 3. Ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease status post three-vessel CABG and subsequent single-vessel PPI. 
She has an RCA stenosis , 70-80% that has not intervened upon. 
On admission , in the setting of respiratory distress , the patient was in sinus tachycardia with rate related to lateral ST depressions. 
Her cardiac biomarkers were positive consistent with NSTEMI. 
It was thought that the patient experienced demand ischemia rather than an acute plaque rupture. 
On 10/8/06 , her troponin peaked at 8.53 , her CK at 275 , and her MB of 16.3. 
The patient was treated with aspirin , Lopressor , and Zocor. 
She was not started on an ACE inhibitor as detailed above. 
She will likely warrant Cardiology followup with possible RCA revascularization. 
Neuro: 1. Sedation: While intubated , the patient was treated with IV Versed and fentanyl titrated to light sedation. 
After her tracheostomy , the patient's Versed and fentanyl drips were discontinued. 
She was treated with Seroquel at bedtime to preclude nighttime agitation. 
Her QTC should be monitored while on Seroquel. 
GI: 1. FEN: The patient initially received tube feeds via feeding tube. 
She underwent a PEG placement on 4/17/06 .  
She continued on tube feeds. 
She also passed speech and Swallow and was thus started on p.o. feeds with aspiration precautions. 
She also received supplemental multivitamins , calcium carbonate , and cholecalciferol. 
The patient will require speech and swallow evaluation at rehabilitation. 
Now that she is awake , she may be able to tolerate oral feeds with aspiration precautions. 
2. Bowel regimen. 
The patient was treated with Colace , senna , and Dulcolax. 
Heme: 1. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia. 
She was continued on iron and folate. 
She may benefit from an outpatient colonoscopy if she has not had one recently. 
2. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: On 4/24/06 , the patient was noted to have bleeding from her tracheostomy site. 
She had no hematocrit drop. 
She remained hemodynamically stable. 
She underwent a bronchoscopy , which showed no active bleeding. 
Her mild bleeding was thought to relate to suction trauma. 
Her prophylactic heparin was held x1 day. 
It was thought that the patient should be discharged on prophylactic heparin because her DVT risk is so high. 
Should the patient have intense bleeding from the tracheostomy site , a hematocrit drop or hemodynamic changes. 
Her heparin subcu should be discontinued , her hematocrit should be monitored closely , and she should be transfused as needed. 
She should also at that point probably undergo reevaluation by Pulmonary or Thoracics. 
Endocrine: 1. Diabetes: The patient was treated with Lantus plus regular insulin q. 6h. plus sliding scale insulin while she was on tube feeds. 
Her insulin was changed on the night prior to discharge. 
She was started on Lantus 100 subq b.i.d. 
She got her first dose of 100 units subq on the evening prior to discharge , her morning sugars were in the mid 100s. 
Her blood sugars should be followed closely on the first one or two days at rehab. 
The blood sugars should be monitored every 2-3 hours and her insulin should be adjusted accordingly. 
Her insulin dose should be adjusted if her tube feeds are cycled rather than given continuously or if she is NPO. 
Ortho: 1. 
Total knee replacement: The patient is status post right total knee replacement on 8/19/06 .  
Her right knee has a well-healed incision and is not erythematous or tender. 
The patient was initially on low-dose anticoagulation with Coumadin. 
Her Coumadin was discontinued given her acute illness and her need for procedures. 
She was treated with heparin subq prophylactic doses 5000 units t.i.d. as described above. 
She will need rehabilitation for her knee. 
2. Prophylaxis: The patient was treated with subcutaneous heparin and Nexium. 
3. Access: The patient has peripheral IVs. 
DISCHARGE STATUS: On the day of discharge 3/8/06 , the patient was afebrile. 
Heart rate was in the 80s , blood pressure was in the 100s-130s/60s-80s. 
Discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. 
The patient was drowsy , but arouseable. 
She was breathing on a trach collar. 
She had decreased breath sounds at the bases. 
She had an S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternal border. 
Her abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel sounds. 
Her trach and PEG site were intact without any surrounding erythema. 
Her extremities were warm without edema. 
She was on trach collar with 50% FiO2 and oxygen saturation of 97%. 
Her discharge labs included a white blood cell count of 21 , stable , hematocrit of 28 , and platelets 436 , 000. 
Her chem-7 included a sodium of 131 , potassium 3 , chloride 87 , CO2 32 , BUN 67 , creatinine 0.8 , and glucose 154. 
Her LFTs were normal. 
Her INR was 1.1. 
Her most recent microdata showed sputum with few polys and a few gram-positive cocci in clusters. 
Her chest x-ray showed a trach in place and bilateral hazy infiltrate consistent with resolving ARDS. 
An addendum will be given with discharge medications and doses. 
At rehab , the patient's weight should be monitored daily. 
Her blood sugars initially be monitored every 2-3 hours. 
After that , her blood sugar monitoring can be spaced out to t.i.d. or whenever deemed appropriate by the physician at the rehabilitation facility. 
Her hematocrit should be checked particularly if she has any bleeding from her tracheostomy site; otherwise , the hematocrit can be checked every day. 
The white blood cell count should be monitored if the patient has any fever. 
The creatinine should be monitored daily in light of the patient's changing diuretic regimen. 
The patient in's and out's should be monitored closely.
