His chest pain is identical to prior episodes occurring during his previous admission. 
He originally presented with 2-3 weeks of generalized weakness with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed with severe polymyositis ( CK up to 33 , 000 ) during last admission. 
He was given IVF+bicarb for renal protection from myoglobinuria and became volume overloaded , with successful diuresis to euvolemia by the time of discharge. 
He had intermittent CP occurring at night , described as nonradiating over left chest associated with SOB. 
He had persistently elevated troponin with no ischemic changes on EKG , and his CP was felt to be due to myocarditis. 
He was treated with ASA , labetalol , isordil , CCB , and ativan with improvement. 
He was started on IV solumedrol with immediate significant improvement in CK ( down to 10 , 000 ) and troponin ( 0.64 ). 
During his 12 hour stay at rehab , he developed CP with SOB occurring at night. 
He was then readmitted to PUO for cardiac catheterization and further care.

10/27 PE CT: Small bilateral pleural effusions , no PE. **** HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Chest pain and shortness of breath. 
He was re-admitted for nocturnal chest pain while at rehab , and concern for myocardial ischemia. 
He underwent cardiac catheterization that showed normal coronary anatomy , suggesting that the elevated CK-MB and troponin were likely from myocarditis , as previously suspected. 
Notably , his chest pain was often associated with shortness of breath. 
It was noted on his prior admission that he had pleural effusions from the high volume diuresis intended to protect his kidneys from myoglobin toxicity , however he had been diuresing well to lasix. 
It was thought that his CP and SOB might be due to PND given his valvular disease. 
Consequently , his vasoldilatory medications were switched to evening dosing , his lasix dose increased , and the head of bed kept elevated at greater than thirty degrees. 
On the day after admission , he had one episode of chest pain with shortness of breath , where he indicated pain in his RUQ. 
A KUB was negative , as was a PE protocol CT , and he responded very well to lasix. 
He had one further episode of SOB at night , again responsive to lasix and position. 
He had a repeat echo that showed no progression of his valvular disease from prior admission and equivalent EF of 70-75%. 
He was maintained on aspirin , labetalol , diltiazem , imdur , and ativan prn. 
2. Arrhythmias. 
He was on rate control with calcium channel blockers. 
He had several noctural few beat runs of NSVT , but no other significant events. 
3. Rhabdo: He has severe polymyositis causing muscle weakness and elevated CK , with possible contribution from cocaine. 
So far , the remaining work up has been negative. 
Preliminary biopx sy shows muscle necrosis and chronic inflammation along with features reminiscent of dermatomyositis. 
He was changed back to IV solumedrol on admission , and switched to PO solumedrol on discharge. 
His CK dropped from 15 , 000 on this admission to 10 , 000 , and then hovered around that dose. 
Rheumatology Consult Fellow Lucy Lobbins felt this was a normal pattern under treatment , and that the true extent of recovery/impairment will only be known in several weeks to months. 
diagnosis. 
4. Renal. 
His Cr was maintained at 1.3-1.5 over the course of his admission , likely related to both renal damage from myoglobinuria and possibly from over-diureses and pre-renal phsyiology , especially in the context of BUN of 42. 
His lasix dose , initially increased on admission due to excellent symptomatic response with diuresis , was in the process of slow tapering at the time of discharge in attempt to identify the appropriate outpatient dosing , with goal of maximizing symptomatic resopnse and minimizing prerenal physiology. 
5. FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Mr Wasmus You were admitted for chest pain , and it was determined by looking at the anatomy of the vessels supplying your heart that you have not had a heart attack caused by diminished blood flow to the heart. 
You do , however , have an inflammatory condition in which your immune system attacks and breaks down your muscle. 
As you know , the recovery process will be long , and you will need to take medication for it for at least four to eight weeks. 
Your rheumatologist , Dr Krinsky , will coordinate your medication and care. 
You have an appointment with her in two weeks. 
Also , you have disease afflicting the valves of your heart , and you will need to see a cardiologist. 
You have an appointment with Dr Fredley for this issue. 
In addition , you have an appointment with your new primary care physician , Dr Killion . 
Please attend all of these appointments , and be sure to take all your medications as prescribed. 
Lastly , it cannot be emphasized enough that your health depends on the care you take of yourself , making sure to stop smoking , stop drinking alcohol , and stop taking any illicit drugs. 
Please seek medical attention for difficulty breathing , worsening weakness , black or bloody stools , or any other concerns. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: 1. Myositis. 
Please follow CK , may need additional agent in the long term. 
Per Rheumatology , response may take weeks. 
2. Chest pain. 
His pain is NOT of ischemic origin. 
He does have rheumatic heart disease , and appears to have PND with pain and shortness of breath that is responsive to lasix , position , and oxygen. 
3. Lasix dosing. 
He will need to be tapered on lasix , with attempt to identify the proper dose for symptomatic relief while not making him pre-renal.
