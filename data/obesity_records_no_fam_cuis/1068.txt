CHIEF COMPLAINT: 63 year old female with hypertension , diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , who presents two days status post a syncopal episode in the setting of chest pain. 
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , postmenopausal , and she has no family history of coronary artery disease , and denies the use of tobacco. 
Her cardiac history is as follows: She has a history of chronic stable angina. 
She underwent a cardiac catheterization in January of 1992 notable for 75% OM2 lesion , 50% ostial right RCA lesion , and ejection fraction at the time was 75%. 
She had an ETT performed in September of 1994 which she exercised for 3 minutes 42 seconds with a peak heart rate of 127 , systolic blood pressure of 156 , rate pressure product of 20k. 
She was stopped secondary to chest pain , she had some T wave inversions in the inferolateral leads felt to be consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
She also had an echocardiogram performed in August of 1994 with an ejection fraction of 60-65% , no regional wall motion abnormalities.

She states that two days prior to admission while walking her normal speed towards the bus station , she developed some right chest wall tightness and shortness of breath consistent with her typical angina. 
She was in the middle of the street , decided to walk across the street with the plan to take a sublingual nitroglycerin , however she felt light headed on continued ambulation and had a syncopal episode.

SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in Clavea alone , no pets. 
She has ten children , 32 grandchildren , and 4 great grandchildren. 
She denies any use of tobacco or denies any use of alcohol. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9 , heart rate of 78 , blood pressure 160/90 , respiratory rate of 20 , with a room air saturation of 93%. 
In general , obese black female in no apparent distress. 
HEENT examination was PERRL , EOMI , neck supple , full range of motion , she had a soft carotid bruit on the left , no bruits on the right , and 2+ pulses bilaterally. 
Lungs were clear. 
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a soft grade 1/6 systolic ejection murmur , best heard at the left lower sternal border. 
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , non-tender , nondistended. 
She was guaiac negative. 
Extremities showed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
2+ femoral pulses , no bruits. 
2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. 
Neurologic examination was grossly nonfocal. 
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG on admission showed a heart rate of 73 , intervals of .164 , .076 , .049 seconds for PR , QRS , and QTC. 
Axis was 71. 
No Q waves and no acute ST or T wave changes. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , bicarb 25 , BUN and creatinine of 16 and 1.3 , glucose of 282. 
LFTs were within normal limits. 
CK of 213 , cholesterol 179. 
Other labs showed a TSH of 1.5 , ferritin 181 , TIBC of 226 , troponin I was 0.0 , hematocrit was 39.4 , white count 7.15 , platelet count of 348 , 000. 
Coagulation studies were within normal limits. 
Urinalysis showed 2-4 WBCs , 3+ bacteria. 
Her urine culture revealed 50 , 000 suspected enteric gram negative rods. 
This is a urine culture from 7/24/96. 
A chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. CARDIAC: Cardiac wise , she ruled out for an MI by enzymes and EKG. 
She underwent a standard Bruce protocol ETT on 7/10/96. 
She exercised for 8 minutes , stopped secondary to fatigue. 
Maximum heart rate was 95 , maximum blood pressure 170/75. 
She developed typical angina in her recovery which spontaneously resolved. 
She had 1 mm down sloping ST segment depressions in II , III , F , V4 through V6 , which resolved into recovery. 
These changes were suggestive of ischemia , but less specific because of her baseline LVH. 
She subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on 7/28/96 , revealing a 40% left main with 90% mid RCA , 90% stenosis at the origin of the PDA , 30% mid LAD , and 50% OM2. 
She subsequently underwent angioplasty of the RCA and the PDA lesion on 4/1/96 with some mild haze at the PDA. 
Therefore , recommendations were for heparinization for a 24 hour period. 
She remained pain free throughout this hospitalization. 
The EPS Service saw her regarding the issue of syncope. 
Further workup was performed including carotid ultrasounds which revealed no significant stenosis in either of the carotid arteries. 
She underwent a cardiac echocardiogram on 2/4/96 to rule out evidence of regional wall motion abnormality that might suggest the possibility of a prior MI as a source of potential ectopy. 
She was noted to have 2+ mitral regurgitation , noted to have an ejection fraction of 74% , and had no reported regional wall motion abnormality. 
She also had no arrhythmias while on monitors throughout the hospitalization. 
The EPS Service agreed with the thought that the ischemia in the RCA probably was the most likely etiology of her syncopal episodes with possible bradycardia during ischemic episodes. 
They favored holding off on the EPS study. 
They felt that the revascularization and follow-up stress testing were the recommended workup for this patient and recommendations are for follow-up ETT in four to six weeks. 
Her medical regimen was adjusted in the form of increasing her Lopressor from 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as her rate and blood pressure tolerated this regimen. 
She remained pain free throughout the hospitalization. 
She will have follow-up with her primary M.D. 2. DIABETES MELLITUS: Her glucose remained under fairly good control during this hospitalization with her regimen of NPH. 
Hemoglobin A1C was checked and is pending at the time of discharge. 
3. URINARY: She was noted to have 3+ bacteria on her urinalysis and 50 , 000 colony forming units on a urine culture of 7/24/96. 
We will empirically treat her for a UTI with Bactrim 1 DS b.i.d. times three days. 
FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up will be with Dr. Leaf She is to have an appointment in one to two weeks. 
She is also to have a follow-up ETT in four to six weeks. 
She should also have a repeat urine culture in the KTDUOO Clinic during her follow-up. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , Synthroid .125 micrograms q.day , metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. , Procardia XL 60 mg q.day , nitroglycerin .4 mg p.r.n. , NPH insulin 66 units q.AM and 15 units subcu q.PM , and Bactrim 1 DS p.o. b.i.d. times three days.
