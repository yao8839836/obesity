=================================================== CONSULTS: None =================================================== ASSESSMENT: 75 yo F with h/o AS , SSS s/p PM , DM2 , restrictive lung disease presenting with acute onset of cough , fever , and worsening shortness of breath over the past three days. 
Pt has a long history of SOB and recently several episodes of falls managed by her PCP , cardiologist , and pulmonologist. 
Workup has thus far been negative for cardiac causes including new arrhythmias , malfunctioning pacemaker or worsening AS per echo done 8/18/07 at TH .  
Elective cath done on 10/15/07 at PUO showed minimal CAD. 
The most recent visit to her pulmonolgist two months ago revealed stable pulmonary function. 
Recent CXRs done at TH suggest there may be a component of pulmonary edema , her presentation at this admission not consistent with worsening pulmonary edema from heart failure of valvular disease. 
An atypical presenation for MI was also ruled out by enzymes. 
Given her acute onset of cough with a fever , the most likely etiology is infectious exacerbated by her poor pulmonary reserve. 
============================================= HOSPITAL COURSE: -------------- 1 ) PULMONARY: Pt kept on ceftriaxone and azithromycin despite a negative CXR and chest PT because of concern for CAP in pt with poor pulmonary reserve. 
Presentation most consistent with a viral etiology.

On HD#2 , patient's breathing markedly improved and was able to wean off of O2 able to sat 95% on room air. 
Pt was able to ambulate on room air without dropping O2 saturation below 90%.
