The patient has had prior admissions for chest pressure but negative ETT 1998-1999 ( ETT-mibi 1999 with no fixed or reversible defects , EF 50% ). 
He reports that 2D ago he developed SS chest pressure with L arm tingling/pain; episode occured at rest and lasted 10-15'. 
He has had a few episodes per day since , almost all at rest ( the patient went up a few flights of stairs last night without difficulty ). 
Not associated with N/diaphoresis/SOB. 
Did not change with position. 
The pt's wife feels that his sx are similar to his complaints in 1999. 
The patient reported a history of "heavy/labored breathing" over past few weeks , concurrent with some weight gain ( the patient had been trying to lose weight but "lost his motivation" and went from 275-&gt;305 10/18 ). 
No PND/orthopnea/DOE , + some mild swelling around ankles. 
Pt also reports URI sx over past week with dry cough/stuffiness , no f/c , + mild nausea. 
URI sx resolved before chest pressure episodes began. 
The pt presented to his PCP with this complaint and was brought to ED , given 1 SLNTG and pressure resolved. 
He also received lopressor 2.5 IV/25 PO and ASA 325. 
Home meds included cardizem/amaryl/prinivil/lipitor/asa/flomax/detrol/ palmitate A. No tob since age 18. +FH early MI. PE in ED: T 96.7 , HR 80 , BP 139/80 , 100% 2L. 
R eye deviated laterally. 
Periph field cut. 
Chest clear. 
JVP 7 cm. 
RRR , I/VI SEM RUSB , obese , nl abd exam , trace pretibial edema. 
EKG no change from prior. 
1st set enz flat. 
Labs Cr 1.4 ( baseline 1.3-1.6 ). 
Hospital course: CV: CAD/ischemia: multiple CRF , past negative ETTs , sx unrelated to exertion but c/w angina otherwise ( pressure/L arm paresthesia ) , with no assoc sx. 
Pt was r/o for MI by serial enz/ekgs. 
Cardizem was dc'd and he was started on lopressor and transitioned to atenolol fo r d/c ( though it was not possible to get an accurate assessment of BP on lopressor given short stay/nitro paste in house. 
) He was continued on ACE/lipitor. 
Stress portion of ETT-mibi ( separate from rest given pt's weight/need for higher doses of marker ): pt walked for 5'20s , reached DP of 24 , 480. 
He had no CP or EKG changes and only small amt SOB at max exertion. 
Mibi showed a small defect in the mid-basal portion of the inf-lateral wall , which if reversible would suggest a small area of ischemia in the OM distribution. 
It was decided that the lesion , even if reversible , was of low enough risk that the patient could go home and return for the rest portion on Monday. 
He was dc'd on his adjusted meds as above and will f/u with Dr. Chan Monday to arrange BP check. 
Pump: the patient did not s how evidence of fluid overload on exam , and it was thought that his inc SOB x 1 mth or more was due to his weight gain , but ECHO was o btained for baseline study and results were pending at dc. DM: amaryl held while in house , ISS. microalbumin/Cr ratio was nl at 6.1 , compared to 51 in 11/14 amaryl restarted for d/c. 
Renal: Cr at baseline ID: s/p URI , resolving: ocean spray GU: detrol/flomax. 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: return to ED if you experience significant chest pain unrelieved by nitroglycerin.
