HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Eguia is a 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease status post a myocardial infarction in September 1995. 
At that time , he had a peak CK of 6 , 700 and an MB fraction of 199. 
His infarction was treated with TPA at Bridgesnecrest Memorial Hospital .  
In January 1995 , he was admitted to Pagham University Of with substernal chest pain. 
A catheterization , at that time , showed 100% left circumflex. 
He had an angioplasty to 20% residual , which was complicated by a small dissection. 
He had an LV gram with inferior hypokinesis , and he also had an 80% OM1 lesion that was angioplastied to 30% residual. 
His ejection fraction was 53%. 
He has been subsequently followed as an outpatient without recurrence of his anginal symptoms. 
Approximately six weeks prior to admission , his Vasotec was changed to Cozaar and his Niacin was changed to Pravachol. 
At that time , he began having some intermittent substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertion. 
Two weeks prior to admission , he was admitted to an outside hospital with a complaint of chest pain. 
He is without current myocardial infarction. 
He had an exercise tolerance test and was then discharged. 
The results of the exercise tolerance test were not available at the time of admission here. 
There was a question of an irregular heartbeat during his exercise and he stopped the procedure secondary to fatigue. 
The patient stopped his own Pravachol and he changed from Cozaar to Vasotec 10 mg q.day , at that time. 
As mentioned above , the patient has had increased frequency of substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertion over the last six weeks. 
At 2 a.m. on the day of admission , the patient experienced a substernal chest pain as a dull ache without radiation. 
He had no other associated symptoms. 
He does not associate the pain with any particular level of exertion , that it can happen sitting still or with activity without any particular pattern. 
With today's episode , he had climbed two flights of stairs and then developed this chest pain which lasted for 10-15 minutes. 
It was not relieved with rest or after one to two tabs of sublingual nitroglycerin. 
By the time he arrived at the Emergency Department , his chest pain was gone. 
In the Emergency Department , his systolic blood pressure was noted to be 230 and he was treated with nifedipine times one and IV nitroglycerin which brought his blood pressure down to 140/90 and he was admitted for evaluation. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , as above. 
Hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times five years , diet controlled , and nasal polyps. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol 5 mg p.o. q.day.
