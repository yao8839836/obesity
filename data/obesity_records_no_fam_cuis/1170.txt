- 4 ) h/o PE w/IVC filter: On coumadin ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: During this admission we evaluated your heart to make sure that it was not the cause of your pain. 
In fact , your studies were improved from your previous studies of yoru heart. 
It seems that your pain is likely more due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we performed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. 
When you have shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice if that helps more ) as well as Tylenol. 
You may also try ibuprofen in small doses. 
Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in generic form in your drugstore. 
It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys so you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge summary. 
Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital we would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day instead of twice a day until Dr. Loudin tells you differently. 
Your medications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your admission. 
If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or any other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention immediately.
