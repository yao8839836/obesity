PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Infected left total hip replacement. 
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Removal of infected cemented left total hip replacement with debridement of the hip and placement of antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers on 2/16/05 . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Breath is a 46-year-old female with multiple medical problems who initially sustained a left hip intertrochanteric fracture in October of 2004 and underwent an ORIF with a DHS on 10/15/04 . 
The screw ultimately cut off and she underwent removal of hardware on 9/28/04 with insertion of a hemiarthroplasty with antibiotic beads. 
Her culture grew coag-negative staph at that time and she was treated with six weeks of IV antibiotics. 
After multiple hip aspirations to confirm that the joint was no longer infected , she underwent a left total hip replacement on 8/15/04 by Dr. Lemmen . 
She ended up being hospitalized in Navzemoyd Boulevard , Ga Cosey , Arizona 41045 from 3/5/05 to 8/16/05 with an E. coli bacteremia of unclear etiology , although it was felt likely secondary to pyelonephritis. 
During that hospitalization , she developed neck pain and was found to have MRSA osteomyelitis at C6-C7. 
She underwent a C6-C7 I&amp;D infusion on 5/24/05 . 
She ultimately completed 16 weeks of IV vancomycin for her MRSA spinal infection and at the completion of the vancomycin therapy in February of 2005 , was started on minocycline with a plan for a six-month treatment. 
She ultimately presented to Dr. Lemmen 's office on 7/13/05 with increasing left groin/hip/lateral thigh pain over several months duration. 
Two left hip aspirates in August , both grew MRSA , and as such , she was scheduled for an explant of her left total hip replacement with insertion of an antibiotic spacer on 2/16/05 .

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single and lives alone in Pring Con She quit smoking tobacco 25 years ago and does not drink alcohol. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for an obese female , ambulates with a walker and an antalgic gait on the left. 
She had mild tenderness with palpation in her mid cervical spine. 
She had some mild distal left upper extremity and proximal left lower extremity weakness. 
Gentle range of motion of her left hip caused pain. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 1/9/05 for initiation of IV antibiotic therapy at the request of the Infectious Disease Service under the direction of Dr. Tiana E Lapin . 
Prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy , she had blood cultures drawn , which ultimately showed no growth. 
Given her neck pain and slight weakness , she also had an MRI of her cervical spine performed , which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. 
Preoperatively , she was seen by both the Infectious Disease Consult Service as well as the Medical Consult Service. 
She was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker at the recommendation of the Medical Consult Service. 
On the morning of hospital day 2 , the beta-blocker was then discontinued under the recommendation of the Medical Consult Service , as it was felt to likely add little benefit. 
She did receive one dose of Coumadin the night before surgery in preparation for DVT prophylaxis. 
She was ultimately taken to the operating room on hospital day 2 where she underwent removal of her left total hip replacement with irrigation , debridement and placement of an antibiotic spacer. 
Estimated blood loss was 2.5 L. She received six units of packed red blood cells , 9 L of crystalloid and 1 L of albumin. 
Intraoperatively , gross pus was found. 
Intraoperative cultures were sent , which ultimately grew MRSA. 
The patient received perioperative stress dose hydrocortisone. 
Postoperatively , she was taken to the surgical intensive care unit and intubated. 
Her postoperative hematocrit was 29.2. 
The morning of postoperative day 1 , the patient remained intubated but was able to open her eyes and follow commands. 
She was neurovascularly intact in the left lower extremity. 
She was treated with Lovenox only initially given that she did not initially have an NG tube so that p.o. medications including Coumadin could be administered. 
She was continued on the vancomycin. 
The patient remained intubated throughout the remainder of postoperative day 1 and into the morning of postoperative day 2. Her hematocrit had drifted down to 22.4 on postoperative day #1 for which she was transfused two units with her hematocrit up to 26.2. 
She continued to remain hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact. 
An NG tube had been placed on postoperative day 1 , so that p.o. medications including her Mestinon could be given for her myasthenia gravis. 
She was ultimately extubated mid morning on postoperative day 2. Her dressing was changed at that time and the incision was clean and intact without any erythema. 
The patient remained in the surgical ICU until postoperative day 3 , mainly with continued pain issues. 
She had been on a fentanyl drip and was transitioned over to Dilaudid PCA. 
She was started on clear diet on postoperative day 3 and transitioned over to regular insulin sliding scale from the insulin drip that she had been on to the early a.m. hours of postoperative day 3. Her hematocrit remained stable in the high 20s. 
Her right IJ central line was changed out over a wire under sterile technique in the ICU on postoperative day 3 prior to transfer to the floor. 
She was transferred to the floor in stable condition lat in the day on postoperative day 3. She was taking p.o.'s at that time and her home medications were restarted including her home prednisone. 
Postoperative day 4 , pain continued to be her main issue and she was seen by the Chronic Pain Service for recommendations on transitioning her off of the high-dose Dilaudid PCA. 
PCA was discontinued and she was started on p.r.n. oxycodone in addition to her home a fentanyl patch and OxyContin. 
Physical Therapy worked with the patient throughout her hospital stay and were able to first sit her up on the edge of the bed on postoperative day 4. She continued to remain afebrile , hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact throughout the remainder of her hospitalization. 
Her hematocrit was stable in the high 20s. 
She had a PICC line placed on postoperative day 5 for administration of her long-term IV vancomycin. 
The Pain Service continued to see the patient and titrate her pain medications with gradually improving effect. 
The Foley was discontinued the morning of postoperative day 6 , as the patient began to be able to move around a little more easily. 
By postoperative day 7 , she was more comfortable , was tolerating a regular diet and voiding q. shift without a Foley. 
She was afebrile , hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact. 
She was continued on both Coumadin and Lovenox given that her INR was still not therapeutic. 
She should continue on the Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge until the INR is therapeutic. 
The patient was cleared for transfer to rehab on postoperative day 7 by the Orthopedic Infectious Disease and Physical Therapy services. 
She was accepted for transfer to the Circ Stonmont Valley Hospital Medical Center in Akson , North Dakota 07986 , Au La Chat DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: To rehabilitation.
