Since being discharged on 7/22/2006 , the patient reported that she had been doing well until the date of admission when she noticed a 2.5-pound weight gain , increased shortness of breath with activity and increased oxygen requirement during the day.

HEENT: She had moist mucous membranes. 
Her oropharynx was clear. 
She had a left pupil which was enlarged and nonreactive secondary to that being a surgical eye. 
Right eye was reactive. 
She had no lymphadenopathy. 
Lungs: left side was clear to auscultation. 
The right side had decreased breath sounds at the base , few crackles at the right base. 
Cardiovascular Examination: She had irregularly irregular rhythm. 
She had a normal S1 , S2 , did not have any murmurs , rubs , or gallops and was found to have a flat JVP on admission. 
Abdominal Examination: She had positive bowel sounds , she was soft , nontender , nondistended. 
She did not have any hepatomegaly. 
Extremities: She was warm and well perfused. 
Distal pulses were not palpable. 
She did have trace edema , left greater than right which was chronic. 
She was alert and oriented x3. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: Pulmonary/Oncology: The patient was admitted in stable condition and was requiring 2 liters of oxygen to keep her saturations in the mid 90s. 
She had a chest x-ray which showed a right pleural effusion. 
Review of previous imaging done on 8/18/2006 demonstrated an area of consolidation in the right lower lobe , which was surrounded by a right pleural effusion of moderate size. 
The patient also had a PET scan in early August , which showed that the consolidation lit up extensively. 
Review of these studies prompted consideration of possible pneumonia versus a bronchioalveolar carcinoma spread. 
Pulmonary was consulted and they suggested starting the patient on antibiotics for possible postobstructive pneumonia. 
She was started on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl on 10/2/2006. 
She received 7 days of these antibiotics while in hospital. 
On day 4 of her hospitalization , a thoracentesis was performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. 
The pleural fluid demonstrated a transudative picture. 
Gram stain was negative. 
Cultures did not grow anything. 
Cytology , preliminary read was negative. 
She had 50 white blood cells and 2000 red blood cells approximately 800 mL were removed and the patient felt much less short of breath following the thoracentesis requiring much less oxygen. 
A followup CT scan was obtained , which showed continued infiltrate in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleural effusion , no pneumothorax was observed. 
Radiology felt that her consolidation was most likely consistent with pneumonia and that it was not postobstructive given that the bronchioles were in fact quite patent and thus it was decided that the patient would continue a 14-day course of levofloxacin with followup with pulmonary to consider whether or not a bronchoscopy would be indicated for further workup of this patient's infiltrate with followup imaging to occur as well. 
Cardiovascularly , for this patient , ischemia wise , the patient did have 2 episodes of chest pain prior to admission. 
She did not have any EKG changes. 
Two sets of cardiac markers were obtained which were both negative , thus assumed that she did not have ischemic event that occurred. 
She was continued on her aspirin and pravastatin while inhouse. 
Pump wise , the patient has a diagnosis of CHF with an EF of 30%. 
She presented approximately 2 kg above her dry weight. 
She was continued on her home dose of torsemide 40 b.i.d. and also on the isosorbide dinitrate although this was increased to 10 mg t.i.d. , she was also started on hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. and did diurese approximately 500 mL to 1 liter each day. 
She returned to her dry weight and on the day of discharge , has a weight of 72.6 kg , had been admitted with a dry weight of 74.9 kg. 
Rhythm wise , the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. 
She was rate controlled with her metoprolol 37.5 mg daily. 
Her Coumadin was continued except for brief period during which it was held prior to the tap of this. 
Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge. 
Endocrine wise , this patient's fingersticks were well controlled. 
She was put on a course of Lantus and NovoLog q.a.c. sliding scale as needed. 
Fingersticks were maintained within a normal range. 
Her Levoxyl was 100 mcg daily , was continued and her allopurinol 100 mg daily was continued for her history of gout. 
On discharge , she is being put back on her glipizide for the diabetes. 
Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition. 
The patient came in hyperkalemic. 
She was given Kayexalate 30 mg x1 in the emergency room to which she responded and had a normal potassium throughout her hospital stay. 
Renal. 
For this , the patient with her diuresis she did and with the addition of the hydralazine , she did have her creatinine drop from 2.2 down to 1.7 during her hospital admission on the day of discharge , it was 1.9 , which is within her baseline for her chronic renal insufficiency. 
Hematology wise , the patient had a stable hematocrit in the low 30s. 
She was continued on her iron 325 twice a day for her iron deficiency anemia. 
LENI's also performed and showed no evidence of DVT.

Heart rate was 71 to 85. 
Blood pressure 100-114 over 40-66. 
She was saturating 93% to 97% on room air. 
Cardiovascular Examination: She was irregularly irregular. 
S1 , S2 were present. 
There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
Her JVP was noted to be 9 cm. 
Examination of her lungs revealed that they were clear to auscultation on the left. 
On the right , she had crackles approximately halfway up , but did not have decreased breath sounds as noted on admission. 
She did not have any pitting edema. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , Colace 100 mg twice a day , ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice a day , glipizide 5 mg twice a day , isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg 3 times a day , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , Toprol XL 100 mg daily , Coumadin 1 mg q.p.m. , multivitamin 1 tablet daily , pravastatin 40 mg daily , torsemide 40 mg twice a day , Nexium 20 mg daily , levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth , q.48h.
