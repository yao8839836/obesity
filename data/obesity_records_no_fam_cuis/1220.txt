HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66-year-old man with diabetes , hypertension , obesity and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the right hip on chemotherapy ( R-CHOP ) , which began on 11/29/06 and will continue for 18 weeks. 
He reported no complications from ischemic chemotherapy. 
At baseline he cannot bear weight on his right leg and he devised this complicated system where he shifts himself down the stairs to the bottom of the steps using his upper body strength and a family member to assist him. 
All during this maneuver he felt unusually short of breath the day of admission and in the context of breathing heavily began to sweat and feel lightheaded and then lost consciousness temporarily. 
Sister was present and called EMS. 
On arrival to the emergency room , he was hypotensive and received IV normal saline as volume resuscitations. 
His pressures initially were noted to be in the 70s to 80s systolic and improved to 90 systolic after 4 L of fluid from the emergency room. 
The patient was admitted for syncope. 
On admission as part of the workup for syncope an initial set of cardiac enzymes was negative. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam , the patient was afebrile , heart rate in the 90s , blood pressure systolic 100 , respirations 20 and O2 sat 94% on room air. 
Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light. 
There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. 
JVP was not visualized due to large neck. 
Lungs were clear.

The extremities had 1+ edema bilaterally. 
The patient was admitted with a preliminary diagnosis of syncope. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The second set of cardiac enzymes was positive with a troponin of 2. Echocardiogram the morning following admission showed a dilated right ventricle consistent with right ventricular strain. 
This was followed by a PE protocol CT scan , which showed a large saddle embolus. 
The patient was treated initially with IV heparin , transitioned to Coumadin and then the decision was made to try Lovenox therapy for long-term anticoagulation. 
Cardiac enzymes normalized.
