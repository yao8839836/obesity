She returned to sleep , but this time sitting up in her sofa. 
She reports that she has been coughing throughout the day with 1 additional fleeting episode of chest tightness this evening. 
She was CP-free upon evaluation in the ED.

Old STD I , II , old TWI I , L. TWF III , F. --- INITIAL IMPRESSION: 63 year old female with history of CAD s/p MI s/p PCI ( stent D1 ) in '02 , HTN , DM , obesity who presents with atypical CP this morning following a fitful coughing episode that awoke her from sleep. 
--- HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. CV: Started on IV Heparin and Lipitor dose increased to 80mg. 
Cont'd b-blocker and full dose aspirin. 
Pt was free of CP upon admission and throughout admission. 
EKG remained at baseline abnormal but showed no overt ischemic changes. 
Her first set of enzymes revealed a slightly elevated CK 371 w/MB fraction of 3.7 , but all three troponins were negative. 
Although her story was not convincing for ACS , her TIMI score=4 ( known CAD , more than 2 episodes in last 24 h , previous ASA use , 3 cardiac RF's of HTN , DM , CHOL ). 
MIBI nondiagnostic b/c of obesity. 
Pt did not tolerate cardiac PET on 8/17 , b/c of anxiety/claustraphobia , then refused to have study w/IVCS. 
Given the fact that pt ruled out for MI , and that pain did not recur , team suspects CP may be related to cough ( M/S and/or pleuritic in etiology ) and no further inpt CAD workup was pursued. 
Pt to f/u w/her cardiologist 11/3 .  
2. RENAL: new ARF likely secondary to taking home lasix in setting of poor PO's , Cr improved to 1.4 after holding Cozaar and diuretics and giving IVF.
