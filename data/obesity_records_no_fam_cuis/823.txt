A UA was dirty and urine culture was sent. 
Pt was not treated with antibiotics , as she was afebrile , asymptomatic , and without leukocytosis. 
Her FeBun was 35.9 , not consistent with intravascular depletion. 
On exam , she appeared euvolemic. 
A repeat ECHO revealed relatively unchanged systolic function. 
A renal ultrasound was within normal limits. 
It is unclear what caused the patient's vacillation in renal function. 
She likely has a narrow range with respect to ideal volume status. 
She was continued on her home torsemide dose while in house. 
Her weight on discharge was 72.5 kg ( 159 lbs ) , very close to her admission weight of 72.7 kg and to her designated dry weight of 159 lbs. 
Her creatinine improved on its own from 2.7 on admission to 1.9 on the day of discharge. 
1.9 represents a value within her baselne creatinine range of 1.8 to 2.2. 
She will need close follow up of her renal function *hyperkalemia* Pt presented with hyperkalemia in setting of worsening renal insufficiency. 
Her peak creatinine was 5.5. 
She recevied kayex on the day of admission. 
Subsequent creatinine measurements were in the 4's without k-binding treatment on the one hand or K supplementation on the other. 
Pt. had been on k supplementation at home. 
Her oral supplements are being held on discharge. 
She will need close follow up of her potassium and may need to resume supplementation on an outpatient basis. 
CV: *CAD s/p multiple PCI* Pt was continued on ASA , bb , statin. 
She was also started on low dose isordil. 
Her BP will need close monitoring on this new medication. 
*BP* Pt was continued on bb and started on isordil , as above. 
On the day of discharge , her standing SBP dropped to 92 from 118 sitting. 
Her HR remained in the 70s. 
She was asymptomatic. 
In light of these changes , she was discharged on torsemide 40 mg PO bid , lower than her home dose and in-hospital dose of 60 mg pO bid. 
She was instructed not to walk without supervision and to stand up slowly from seated position. 
*CHF* Pt was thought to be clinically euvolemic on exam. 
Her BNP was in the 800s. 
Her repeat ECHo showed an EF of 30% , relatively unchanged from previous ECHO 3/24 She was continued on her home torsemide dose while in house and discharged on a lower dose of torsemide as described above. 
*MVR* Stable. 
*afib* Pt was rate controlled with bb. 
Her INR was subtherapeutic on admission. 
In light of this , her coumadin dose was increased from 1 to 2 while in house. 
Her INR rose to 1.9 on discharge. 
Her coumadin dose was downgraded to 1. 
She will need close follow up of her INR. 
HEME: *iron deficiency anemia* Pt. was continued on iron. 
Colonoscopy could be considered but may not be indicated given pt.'s prognosis from known lung malignancy. 
ONC: *lung CA* Pt has CXR findings likely related to her known malignancy. 
She will f/u with her outpatient oncologist. 
PULM: *o2 requirement* Pt was noted to desat to 87% while ambulating. 
Home O2 was arranged. 
Etiology of pt.'s new oxygen requirement likely relates to underlying lung malignancy , and perhaps to her CHF - although she appears compensated from that standpoint. 
ENDO: *DM* Pt was treated with SSI while in house and was discharged on her home glipizide. 
She was continued on her home levoxyl. 
RHEUM: *gout* Pt was continued on her prophylactic allopurinol. 
PROPH: nexium/coumadin ****DISCHARGE STATUS: On discharge , pt. is afebrile , P 70s SBP 90s-110s satting 95% 2L. 
Exam unchanged from admission. 
hct 31 , Cr 1.9 , INR 1.9 ****DISPOSITION: Pt is being discharged to home with VNA services ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: TO PT: -You were admitted with worsening kidney function. 
An ultrasound of your kidneys was normal and your kidney function improved. 
-During this hospitalization , we added a new medication called isordil 5 mg three times per day. 
We decreased your dose of torsemide to 40 mg two times per day. 
In addition , we stopped your medication called potassium. 
You will have your potassium levels checked and your outpatient physicians will decide on whether you need to restart potassium and at what level. 
-We arranged for you to have home oxygen. 
Use it while sleeping and when you feel short of breath. 
Do not smoke or cook on the stove while using oxygen. 
Stay away from open flames. 
-Do not stand up quickly from a seated position and do not walk without supervision. 
We noticed your blood pressure is lower when you stand and we do not want you to get dizzy and fall , especially as you are on coumadin. 
Do not drive. 
-Return to the emergency room or call your doctor if you have increasing shortness of breath , weight gain , chest pressure or jaw pain , dizziness , lightheadedness , palpitations , abdominal pain , vomiting , or diarrhea. 
-Take prescription for blood draw to PUO on 11/25 Have INR , chem 7 , and magnesium checked. 
As per script , results should be faxed both to Dr. Kum Pidro fax 934-555-1526 and to Dr. Coletta Verry tel 575-803-4363 To VNA: -monitor O2 sat on home O2 - do heart rate and blood pressure check - check weight - notify Dr. Coletta Verry 575-803-4363 if weight increases or decreases by 2 pounds in 3 days DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair TO DO/PLAN: PCP/cards: -Monitor creatinine. 
Pt.'s creatinine improved from 2.7 to 1.9. 
Baseline 1.8-2.2 in past. 
FeBUN was 35.9% and BUN/Cr ratio was 20. 
We continued torsemide 60mg po bid. 
Renal ultrasound was normal bilaterally. 
-Monitor potassium. 
Pt.'s K decreased from 5.5 to 4.1. 
She did not require potassium supplementation while in the hospital. 
Her outpatient dose of potassium was held. 
This may need to be restarted if her potassium decreases below 4. -F/u official results of urine culture , send secondary to dirty UA. Pt not treated as afebrile , asymptomatic , nl wbc count. 
-Monitor hct - stable in low 30s. 
Pt has known iron deficiency anemia and is on iron. 
-Monitor INR on coumadin. 
Goal INR is 2-3. 
Pt had been on 1 mg PO qd coumadin at home. 
Her INR on admission was 1.5. 
She was treated with coumadin 2 mg PO qd. 
Her INR rose to 1.9 on the day of discharge. 
She was discharged again on coumadin 1 mg PO qd. VNA should draw her INR on 4/29 and fax results to her PCP. 
-Monitor blood pressure on isordil. 
On low dose 5mg po tid currently. 
-Monitor SOB on home o2. Pt. desatted to 87% while ambulating on RA. 
Her subjective shortness of breath improves tremendously on 2L. PET scan suggests progressive lung CA. -Patient is DNR/DNI and her healthcare proxy is her husband.
