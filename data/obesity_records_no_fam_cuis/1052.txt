010700797 | PUO | 27527229 | | 330698 | 1/9/1995 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 6/22/1995 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 11/26/1995 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. CHEST PAIN , FOR RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES 3. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION 4. HYPERTENSION HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old , vietnamese speaking woman with multiple cardiac risk factors who presented complaining of unstable chest pain. 
The patient's cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history , previous history of smoking as well as postmenopausal state secondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogen replacement therapy. 
The patient has a two to three year history of exertional angina. 
Of note , approximately one year ago she began to have substernal chest pain at rest. 
The patient states that currently she is having approximately three episodes a day on average. 
She describes these as substernal chest pressure which radiates to her bilateral arms as well as her jaw. 
She denies any associated shortness of breath but does occasionally note diaphoresis. 
She denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations. 
In September of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction of approximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild tricuspid regurgitation. 
Since this time she has been followed by Dr. Chas Petrov in KTDUOO Clinic who initiated an antianginal regimen which resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. 
Of note the patient recently stopped taking Aspirin. 
Her symptoms then recurred. 
On the 5 of February , 1995 the patient underwent a Dobutamine MIBBE on which she went 6 minutes and 48 seconds reaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82. 
The test showed 2 mm ST depressions diffusely. 
The MIBBE showed moderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wall ischemia. 
Of note , on the morning of admission the patient was seen by her VNA. 
During her VNA's visit the patient began to have her typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw as well as shortness of breath. 
She denied any diaphoresis or nausea. 
The patient was given three sublingual Nitroglycerins after her primary M.D. was called and her pain resolved after approximately 15 minutes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for a 10 year history of Insulin dependent diabetes with complications including neuropathy and retinopathy. 
Chronic atrial fibrillation included a normal TSH. 
Hypertension. 
Degenerative joint disease. 
Gastroesophageal reflux. 
Status post hysterectomy approximately 21 years ago. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. which the patient recently stopped , Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopipd 600 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Insulin , NPH , 75 units sub-q q.a.m. , 50 units q.p.m. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her heart rate was 58 , blood pressure 141/73 , O-2 saturation 97% on 2 liters , respiratory rate 16 and unlabored. 
HEENT exam showed pupils equal round and reactive to light. 
Extraocular movements were intact. 
Oropharynx was clear. 
Mucous membranes were moist. 
Neck was supple with full range of motion. 
Jugular venous pressure was difficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around the neck. 
Carotids were 2+ and without bruits. 
Cardiac exam showed an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal S-1 and S-2 , a I/VI systolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border. 
Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. 
Abdomen was soft , nontender , obese with active bowel sounds. 
Extremities showed a right shin scar which was healing well. 
There was no clubbing or cyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. 
Rectal examination was guaiac negative. 
On neurologic examination the patient was alert and oriented x 2. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact. 
Strength was 5/5 bilaterally. 
There was decreased sensation to light touch bilaterally in the lower extremities. 
LABORATORY DATA: On admission Sodium 134 , Potassium 4.7 , Chloride 96 , Bicarb 22 , BUN 28 , Creatinine 1.3 , Blood Glucose 472 , Digoxin level 1.0. 
PT 14.5 , PTT 26. Urinalysis was negative. 
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 60 with a normal axis. 
T wave inversions were noted in both leads 3 and F and Q waves were noted in V-1 through V-3. 
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of infiltrates or effusions. 
There was borderline cardiomegaly. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Medicine Team Hi Co She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial CK , MB and EKG's. 
Heparin was initially started given the possibility that this was unstable angina. 
The Cardiology Team was consulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization. 
On further review of her history the Cardiology Team decided to schedule a cardiac catheterization. 
This was performed on the 7 of October and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including a right atrial pressure of 15 , an RV pressure of 50/16 with a mean PA pressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. 
The coronary arteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function was also assessed as normal. 
The patient tolerated this procedure well and without complications. 
Given the confluence of her data , two possible explanations were postulated including either syndrome X or small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. 
The patient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization and was prepared for discharge. 
Also during her hospital course the patient's Insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep her blood sugars in the approximately 200 range.
