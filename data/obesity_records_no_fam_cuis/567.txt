Psychiatry has seen the patient in the past per her and felt there was some overlying secondary gain from hospitalizations given her depression. 
The patient had declined medication for depression in the past but on last admission clexa was started. 
This medication will need to be increased after discharge. 
It was felt that the patient would benefit from rehab per PT and that this would give time for her home situation to improve. 
Patient lives on top floor and has difficulty leaving. 
She is in for alternative housing.
