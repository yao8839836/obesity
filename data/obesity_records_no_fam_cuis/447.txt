Discharge Date: 1/6/2005 ATTENDING: EARNESTINE M. FIERMONTE M.D. SERVICE: Cardiology. 
ADMISSION INFORMATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease , status post remote IMI ( catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes , hypercholesteremia , hypertension , admitted on 5/1/2005 for chest pain. 
The patient experienced substernal chest pain radiating to her left arm and shoulder while moving sofa. 
She had associated diaphoresis and nausea but no shortness of breath. 
She took 1 sublingual nitroglycerin and 2 aspirin. 
She was subsequently transferred to the emergency department. 
There , her vital signs were stable. 
She was found to have new right bundle-branch block and ST elevations in leads I , aVL , and V2 through V6 as well as ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF. 
She was treated with 5 sublingual nitroglycerin tablets , aspirin , heparin , Lopressor , and morphine. 
She was subsequently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab , then transferred to the CCU for further management. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CVA ( remote ) , CAD ( status post remote IMI; catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesteremia , hypertension , diverticulosis , spinal stenosis , disk disease , osteoarthritis , status post total knee replacement , positive PPD in the past. 
HOME MEDICATIONS: Medications unknown to patient ( patient receives care at Tempson Neistone Ino Hospital ). 
ALLERGIES: Tetanus toxoid. 
ADMISSION EXAM: Pulse 70 , blood pressure 155/77. 
General Appearance: Well-nourished woman. 
Neck: JVP 12 cm. 
Lungs: Right-sided wheezes. 
Cardiovascular: S1 , S2 regular in the 70s , 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. 
Abdomen: Soft , nontender , nondistended. 
Extremities: Right groin hematoma with superficial ecchymosis. 
Extremities warm with 2+ pulses. 
ADMISSION LABS: White blood cell count 13 , hematocrit 44.8 , platelets 247 , 000. 
Coags within normal limits. 
Sodium 133 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 97 , CO2 23 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 221. 
Baseline EKG , 2001 , normal sinus rhythm , 82 beats per minute , first-degree A-V block , Q waves in leads II , III , and aVF. 
Admission EKG , 5/1/2005 , precatheterization: Normal sinus rhythm , 98 beats per minutes , first-degree A-V block , right bundle-branch block , Q waves in leads II , III , and aVF , ST elevations in leads 1 , aVL , V2 through V6. Admission chest x-ray , mild cardiomegaly , pulmonary vascular engorgement and cephalization. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Anterolateral ST-elevation MI - On 5/1/2005 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 100% stenosis of the LAD , 60% stenosis of the left circumflex , 80% stenosis of the first marginal , and 100% stenosis of the RCA , with collateral flow from the LAD to the RCA. 
Her LAD was stented. 
She was treated with Integrilin , aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , and Lipitor. 
Her peak cardiac markers were on 8/29/2005 and were as follows: CK 3344 , MB 386.4 , troponin I 191.4. 
Her EKG changes were slow to resolve. 
Her admission EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm , first-degree A-V block , and new right bundle-branch block. 
On 8/29/2005 , the patient developed transient complete heart block. 
Gel pads were placed , but the patient regained her native rhythm. 
A temporary wire was placed. 
On 4/21/2005 , the temporary wire failed to capture and was adjusted. 
On 1/23/2005 , the patient was taken back to the cardiac catheterization lab with the idea of precluding any further ischemic triggers to complete heart block. 
A stent was placed in the first marginal. 
On 10/4/2005 , early in the morning , the patient aroused from bed ( despite bed-rest precautions ). 
Her temporary wire was apparently dislodged. 
This wire was then pulled. 
The patient developed chest pain without EKG changes. 
She subsequently developed hypotension. 
There was clinical evidence of tamponade including distant heart sounds and cool extremities. 
The patient was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. 
A stat echo performed in the cardiac catheterization lab revealed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle. 
A pericardiocentesis was performed for 600 mL of bloody fluid. 
It was thought that the temporary wire had perforated the right ventricle and that the whole failed on its own. 
In the cardiac catheterization lab , the patient developed asystole. 
A temporary wire was replaced. 
On 8/3/2005 and 10/22/2005 , echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation. 
The patient's ejection fraction was preserved at 45 to 50%. 
There was evidence of hypokinesis of the apical , inferoseptal , and basal and mid inferior walls. 
On 10/22/2005 , the patient's second temporary wire was pulled. 
The patient remained in her native rhythm. 
She had rare runs of asymptomatic NSVT ranging from 5 to 11 beats. 
She was without chest pain or shortness of breath for the duration of her hospital stay. 
It was thought that the patient did not require a permanent pacemaker or AICD placement at the present time. 
The patient was discharged on aspirin , Plavix , Toprol , lisinopril , and Lipitor. 
She had not been on a statin previously. 
Her LFTs will require monitoring. 
Notably , her fasting lipids included total cholesterol of 136 , an HDL of 38 , an LDL of 98 , and triglycerides of 149. 
2. PULMONARY: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula during her hospitalization. 
Status post pericardiocentesis , she was weaned off oxygen. 
On the day of discharge , she was able to ambulate on room air without desaturating. 
3. ENDOCRINE: Diabetes mellitus. 
The patient was on oral antihyperglycemics at home. 
In-house , she was treated standing Lantus as well as Novolog standing and sliding scale q.a.c. 
She was discharged on metformin. 
She has a normal creatinine clearance. 
4. HEME: Hematocrit. 
The patient's hematocrit dropped down from the low 40s on admission to the low 30s on discharge. 
This drop was attributed largely to blood loss ( right groin hematoma status post 5/1/2005 cardiac catheterization - subsequently stabilized; and pericardiocentesis on 10/4/2005 ). 
There was a desire to keep the patient's hematocrit above 30 given her acute coronary syndrome; however , the patient refused for transfusion. 
In the days prior to discharge , the patient's hematocrit stabilized. 
If her hematocrit remains low , she might benefit from outpatient anemia workup , including iron studies , B12 , folate , reticulocyte count , and smear. 
5. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Urinary tract infection. 
The patient developed a urinary tract infection. 
Urine culture on 8/29/2005 showed greater than 100 , 000 proteus. 
She was treated initially with levofloxacin , then Bactrim. 
A urine culture from 8/3/2005 showed no growth. 
6. POSTPROCEDURE PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was treated transiently with Ancef status post temporary wire placement. 
Blood cultures on admission were negative. 
Blood cultures were not rechecked given that the patient remained afebrile without signs of bacteremia. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) 1 tab sublingual every 5 minutes x3 doses , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. daily , metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to take her medications as directed , particularly the Plavix. 
The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. Fiermonte in clinic on 6/24/2005 and with Dr. Genevie Prosperi at the Tempson Neistone Ino Hospital .  
She was instructed to call her doctor and present to the emergency room if she experienced any chest pain , shortness of breath , palpitations , fainting , or any other symptoms concerning to her. 
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with home services.
