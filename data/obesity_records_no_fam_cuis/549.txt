994785515 | PUO | 33070418 | | 6550230 | 10/4/2005 12:00:00 AM | CHRONIC HEART FAILURE , PNEUMONIA | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 1/18/2005 Report Status: Signed 

Discharge Date: 8/10/2005 ATTENDING: DEPSKY , GWYNETH ALMEDA MD PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Endocarditis , urinary tract infection. 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Mitral regurgitation , diabetes , hypertension , congestive heart failure , recurrent UTIs , uterine prolapse , hyperlipidemia , hiatal hernia , right breast nodule. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old with a history of severe mitral regurgitation , history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 60% in 6/8 , chronic abdominal discomfort , history of recurrent UTIs , and uterine prolapse , who one week prior to admission developed increased nausea , decreased appetite , weakness , fatigue and increased low back pain. 
No vomiting , diarrhea , cough , or dysuria. 
On presentation , the patient was found to be hypotensive , in septic shock , with bacteremia in urinary tract infection and admitted to the Medical ICU for pressure support. 
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for heart rate of 94 , blood pressure of 80-90/50. 
Notable for heart exam with regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , with 3/6 systolic crescendo murmur and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border radiating to the clavicles and carotids , and 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla , and an apical heave. 
JVP flat. 
Chest with crackles in the right middle lung fields and leg basilar crackles. 
Abdominal exam was benign. 
Guaiac negative. 
Extremities with no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. 
RELEVANT STUDIES AND TESTS: Blood culture on 10/13 Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC 0.19. 
Urine culture on 10/13 Greater than 100 , 000 Klebsiella pneumoniae , ampicillin resistant , gentamicin sensitive , and levofloxacin sensitive. 
TEE on 10/17 Severe mitral regurgitation , posterior leaflet with mitral calcifications and linear density concerning for endocarditis. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: IMPRESSION: A 76-year-old female with mitral regurgitation , history of CHF , history of recurrent UTI , who presented with nausea and chills , had hypotension requiring a medical ICU stay x 2 days , with Streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitral calcifications in linear density concerning for endocarditis plus Klebsiella UTI. 1. Infectious disease: The patient presented with chills and hypotension and was admitted to the MICU from the ED for treatment of septic shock. 
Her mean arterial pressures were kept above 65 with Levophed. 
She initially was treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin to treat Gram-positive cocci bacteremia and UTI. 
Blood culture from 5/15 , grew out Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC 0.19. 
Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella , ampicillin resistant , gentamicin and levofloxacin sensitive. 
On 1/11 , antibiotics were changed to penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h. 
and gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. 
ATEE on 5/29 showed severe mitral regurgitation with posterior leaflet calcifications and linear density concerning for endocarditis. 
Therefore , a PICC line was placed on 10/11 for continuation of a six-week course of penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h. 
until 1/3 and two-week course of gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. 
until 9/12 .  
She will follow up in the Infectious Disease Clinic with Dr. Rossie Mankoski on 1/5/05 at 8 a.m. 2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was maintained on aspirin. 
Lipitor was initially helped for an initial transaminitis presumed to be secondary to shock liver , that at the time of discharge her liver enzymes had normalized and she was restarted on her Lipitor. 
Pump: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure , with an ejection fraction 60% in 6/8 .  
She had hypotension , requiring Levophed until 2/5 .  
She had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on 6/16 in the setting of fluid bolus and one unit of packed red blood cells. 
She has a very attenuatus balance between preload dependence and overload. 
Her Lasix and ACE-I were held while she was hypotensive. 
Because her systolic blood pressure continued to be low in the 90s and low 100s , attempt was not made to re-add the ACE while in the hospital. 
It is anticipated that her cardiologist and outpatient physicians will attempt to add the ACE back onto her medical regimen for better afterload reduction as her blood pressure tolerates. 
The patient also has a very severe mitral regurgitation , which would be one of the reasons that an ACE on her medication regimen would be beneficial. 
Rhythm: The patient was maintained on telemetry , and was found to be a normal sinus rhythm with ectopy , including short once of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. 
She was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. on 1/11 , and this was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. at discharge , with her heart rates continuing to be between the 70s and the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy. 
Her electrolytes were also well repleted. 
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient had evidence of shock liver ( 4/10 with an ALT of 135 , AST of 177 , alkaline phosphatase of 251 , and T bili of 1.7 ) that is now resolving. 
Lipitor was held , and was started as a transaminitis resolved. 
Non-contrast CT of the abdomen showed biliary sludge and gallstones , no evidence of acute cholecystitis. 
Right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmed the CT findings. 
Colon cancer is a concern with the patient's anemia being new since 5/8 .  
Her last colonoscopy was in 2000 , and she will benefit from repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient. 
She was continued on Nexium for prophylaxis. 
Heme: The patient had guaiac positive stools in the medical ICU , her hematocrit was stable around 33%. 
She has a microcytic anemia with an MCV of 79 , her iron studies ( iron of 10 , TIBC of 191 , ferritin is 744 ) suggesting anemia of chronic disease with possibly overlying iron deficiency. 
4. Endocrine: The patient had a normal random cortisol level of 35.3. 
She had an uncertain diagnosis of diabetes and was on the Portland protocol in the medical ICU. 
Hemoglobin A1c , however , was 6.5. 
Therefore , she was maintained thereafter only on insulin sliding scale and rarely required any coverage. 
5. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Lovenox and Protonix. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , iron sulfate 325 mg daily , gentamicin sulfate 50 mg IV q.8h. 
until 9/12 for a two-week course , penicillin G potassium 3 million units IV q.4h. 
until 1/3 for a six-week course , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Caltrate plus D2 tablets p.o. daily , Lipitor 10 mg daily , and Protonix 40 mg daily. 
The patient has not been restarted on her home Lasix and lisinopril secondary to persistently low blood pressures between the 90s and 100s. 
It is anticipated that especially her Lisinopril and her Lasix will be added back on to her medical regimen as her blood pressure tolerates. 
Given that she was no longer on Lasix , she was also taken potassium chloride. 
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation at Sa Pehall in order to be able to get her antibiotic therapy. 
She was discharged on stable condition. 
PHYSICIANS FOLLOW-UP: The patient has been following follow-up appointments: 1. Stress test in 2/6/05 at 3 p.m. 2. Dr. Germaine Blackgoat ( general cardiology ) on 7/10/05 at 10 a.m. 3. Dr. Gaye Franza 3/22/05 at 12 p.m. 4. Dr. Rossie Mankoski ( infectious disease ) 1/5/05 at 8 a.m. 
The patient will follow up regarding the success of her antibiotic therapy. 
It is also anticipated that her cardiologist will re-add back on her ACE for better afterload reduction as her blood pressures tolerates , and potentially we will add her back on to the Lasix as well. 
She will require weekly lab draws to check her electrolytes and CBC while she is on the antibiotics.
