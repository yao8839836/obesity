On 5/16/91 , he had a positive ETT which was stopped secondary to chest pain. 
The EKG showed 2 mm ST depressions in two , three , F and V4 through V6. 
He was encouraged to have a cardiac catheterization , but he was reluctant to do this. 
He has good exercise tolerance; takes long walks with his wife without chest pain and swims for an hour a day. 
He had a cardiac catheterization on the day of admission which showed 70% left main , 100% left circumflex , 100% RCA and 90% LAD.
