She had URI symptoms about two weeks ago and then 5d pta developed minimal ly productive cough and then SOB for the past 2-3 days. 
She denies any noctural dyspnea or increase in number of pillows. 
She lives alone , and a reverend checks up on her daily; the day prior to admission he suggested she go to the hospital. 
She does not feel that she had any speech difficulties at that time , but when she awoke she noted heaviness of her tongue and workd finding difficulties. 
In addition , she had sweating and chest pain that radiated to her shoulder ( L&gt;R ) , and back. 
This was different than her usual anginal symptoms ( which do not involve back radiation ). 
The pain was pleuritic in nature , and she denied palpitations. 
She also noticed nausea and had several episodes of dry heaving. 
While leaving the bathroom she had a single episode of "lightheadness." 
This did not involve any sensation of vertigo , or any vision changes. 
She sat down immediately , and felt better within a few seconds. 
There was no fall and no LOC. 
Around 8am , her housekeeper came , and immediately noticed a change in Mrs. Lippman 's voice. 
Mrs. Lippman describes the change as a "thickening of my tongue" and some problems finding words. 
She has been taking all of her medications as prescribed over the last week. 
ROS: On arrival to the floor , Mrs. Lippman noted a raised , painful area on her L forearm. 
She does not recall any trauma to the area. 
She denies any fever.

Gait: not assessed. 
Hospital course by system: Neuro: Speech difficulties: resolved by the time pt was in ER , making diagnosis difficult. 
Possible etiologies include TIA or illness exacerbating deficits from old stroke. 
Head CT in ER showed old infarcts , but no acute process. 
Patient did not have any speech difficulties throughout admission or other neurologic findings. 
CV: ischemia: No ST changes on EKG , one set of cardiac enzymes were negative. 
Given low probability of ischemia , no further enzymes were drawn. 
Pump: EF 55% , patient was normotensive even after d/c of some of her home HTN meds ( see renal ). 
Rhythm: pt was on telemetry for first day of admission , and alternated between sinus rhythm and afib. 
Pulm: PNA: pt had left lower lobe opacity on CXR. 
Decision was made to start antibiotics. 
Pt had a positive d-dimer , but PE was very unlikely in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. 
The patient has a history of CHF , but had no signs of CHF on exam during this hospitalizaiton although her cxr was read as mild pulmonary edema. 
Renal: ARF: Creatine on admission was 1.8 , up from a baseline of 1.2-1.3. 
Given her h/o poor po intake and euvolemic to dry exam , this was thought likely due to prerenal hypovolemia. 
Her lasix , lisinopril and colchicine were held , as they might contribute to further ARF , and she got gentle ivf ( approximately 1L ) and her creatinine improved. 
However , after restarting her medications her Cr again bumped to 1.8. 
Her UA was unremarkable. 
She was d/c home off lasix , lisinopril and colchicine with a Cr of 1.8 presuming that sh e was still prerenal. 
The plan is for VNA to check her chem7 in 3days days , results to go to Dr. Aspacio for monitoring and deciding when to restart her medications. 
MSK: Pt developed the left forearm swelling and pain while in the hosp for the first night. 
A radiograph was negative for fracture and it was felt to be a small hematoma. 
The pain remitted with Tylenol. 
At discharge the pain was a dull ache , and the swelling was reduced. 
Heme: Anticoagulation. 
She was maintained on her home dose of INR was maintained in a theraputic range. 
This will have to be closely monitored as an outpatient while on levofloxacin. 
Her INR was 3 after 2 days of levofloxacin and will be checked again by VNA 3 days after discharge , results to be followed by Darin Jeffirs Endo: D.M. Pt was switched from micronase to glipizide 2.5mg qd given her worsening renal insufficiency. 
Fingersticks remained in acceptable range ( 100-148 ) during admission. 
Dispo: to home with close VNA followup ( daily ). 
Pt will have weight and BP checked qd. 
She will have Chem-7 and INR drawn on Thursday and Monday , and the results will be called to Dr. Aspacio ( KTDUOO ). 
She will finish 6 more days of Levo ( total 10 ). 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you develop a fever , become short of breath , have increasing left arm pain , or any other symptoms that concern you , call your doctor.
