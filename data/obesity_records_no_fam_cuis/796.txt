799534280 | PUO | 62210422 | | 5663423 | 9/27/2002 12:00:00 AM | LEFT ATRIAL MYXOMA | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 9/27/2002 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 11/28/2002 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Orduna is a 70-year-old gentleman who went to see primary care physician and presented with aphasia. 
MRI was sent at that time , which revealed a left parietal infarct. 
A transesophageal echocardiogram was done , which revealed a large left atrial myxoma with prolapse across the mitral valve into the left ventricle with a pedunculated stock. 
The patient does not have symptomatic heart failure and is normal sinus rhythm. 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography and atherectomy with stent placement , history of recent cerebrovascular accident , diabetes mellitus , oral agent treatment , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , remote history of gout , chronic renal insufficiency , status post angioplasty and stenting procedures , and anemia. 
He is status post a right nephrectomy in 1999 , with renal cell carcinoma and right knee replacement in 2001 , and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the year 2001. 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 4/26/02 , which revealed a left anterior descending coronary artery with a 40% stenosis , first obtuse marginal coronary artery with a 60% stenosis , a right coronary artery with a 60% stenosis and a right dominant circulation , ejection fraction of 50%. 
The patient underwent an echocardiogram on 1/9/02 which revealed the following: ( 1 ) Left ventricular cavity size with wall thickness and systolic function appeared normal with an ejection fraction of 55% , with no akinetic areas seen. 
( 2 ) The right ventricle appears normal in size and systolic function. 
( 3 ) The aortic valve is trileaflet without evidence of dysfunction. 
( 4 ) The mitral leaflets appear mildly thickened. 
There is light retrace mitral regurgitation. 
The left atrium is enlarged. 
( 5 ) A large heterogeneous multilobulated mass is seen within the atrium. 
It appears to be attached by a stalk to the interatrial septum. 
The mass measures approximately 7 x 3.5 cm and prolapses to the mitral valve and to the left ventricle. 
The distal portion of this mass has more mobile element. 
A mild amount of inflow obstruction is noted , and there is also mild valvular incompetence. 
The appearance of the mass is most consistent with myxoma , although other primary and secondary neoplasms are also possible. 
Thrombus is seen much likely , but superimposed thrombus formation overlying the main mass is possible. 
( 6 ) The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is trace tricuspid regurgitation with peak velocity of 2.7 m/sec predicting pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 29 mmHg plus right atrial pressure. 
( 7 ) There is no evident pericardial effusion. 
( 8 ) No prior studies are available for comparison. 
( 9 ) Findings reviewed with clinical team. 
The patient also underwent a MRI of the brain which revealed the following: ( 1 ) Left parietal infarct. 
( 2 ) Bilateral posterior communicating arteries. 
Otherwise , normal vasculature. 
The patient was seen by the neurology service who recommended that the patient did not proceed with his cardiac surgery at this time. 
He will be discharged to home and be readmitted on 2/19/02 in the year 2002 for his cardiac surgery. 
He has otherwise had an uneventful hospital course and will be discharged to home in stable condition. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
MEDICATIONS: Celexa 40 mg q.d. , atenolol 100 mg q.d. , allopurinol 100 mg q.d. , glyburide 5 mg q.a.m. and Lipitor 10 mg in the evening. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm , with no murmurs , rubs or heaves. 
RESPIRATORY: Breath sounds clear bilaterally. 
NEURO: Alert and oriented with an expressive aphasia. 
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA: Glucose 88 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.7 , sodium 140 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 102 , CO2 27. 
WBC 8.12 , hemoglobin 9.0 , hematocrit 28.6 , platelets 262. 
ESR 87. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg 1 p.o. q.d. atenolol 100 mg q.d. , Lipitor 10 mg q. evening , allopurinol 100 mg q.d. , glyburide 5 mg q. morning , Celexa 40 mg q.d. 
Mr. Orduna will be discharged to home in stable condition.
