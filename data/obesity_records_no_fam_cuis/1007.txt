BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE: IDENTIFICATION: 81M with a h/o CAD s/p 2-vessel CABG , redo LIMA to LAD , and PCIx4 admitted w/ 2 month h/o increasingly frequent exertional CP. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lothamer reports increasingly frequent exertional CP over the past 2 months that has been occurring about twice daily for the past 2 weeks. 
Described as sub-sternal pressure , 5/10 , w/o radiation , and relieved within 10-15 minutes of rest. 
Now occurring w/ walking 2-3 blocks at a normal pace. 
Also describes near daily CP upon waking up , relieved within 30 minutes of resting. 
Has not been taking sl. nitro. 
CP not associated w/ SOB , nausea/vomiting , nor diaphoresis. 
No PND , orthopnea , palpitations , nor LE swelling. 
For evaluation of these symptoms , he underwent a cardiac MRI , myocardial perfusion w/ adenosine stress that was abnormal. 
Cardiac cath. 
was recommended , but he sought a 2nd opinion at an TH in Tucno Day Inland On arrival to this TH on 10/27 , he was found to be diaphoretic and orthostatic w/ an SBP as low as 70. 
He was thought to be volume-depleted and admitted for further evaluation. 
No EKG changes were noted and cardiac enzymes were negativex3. 
It was recommended to proceed to cardiac cath. 
at TH . 
He chose to come to PUO ( b/c all of his cardiac care in the past has been here ) and was transferred on 10/9 for elective cardiac cath. 
No CP , nor SOB at admission.

LHC w/ 3VD and successful PCI to SVG to Marg2. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. CARDS ISCHEMIA: Chronic stable angina w/ negative enzymesx3 and no EKG changes. 
Recent abnormal cardiac MRI suggests progression of CAD. 6/13/2006 LHC demonstrated the following: 1. 
Right dominant 2. No significant LM lesions 3. LAD ( proximal ) discrete 1005 lesion after D1 origin. 
D1 widely patent including prior stent. 
LAD ( mid ) w/ a discrete 100% lesion. 
4. Cx ( proximal ) with a discrete 100% lesion. 
5. RCA ( proximal ) with a discrete 100% lesion. 
6. LIMA to LAD patent , but distal LAD occluded ( small vessel disease ) 7. SVG to Marg2 ( distal ) w/ a tubular 70% lesion 8. SVG to Right PDA ( ostial ) w/ a discrete 100% lesion. 
9. Collateral flow from Marg2 to right PDA. 10. PCI: SVG TO MARG2 TO 0% W/ A 3.5 mm CYPHER POSTDILATED TO 4.0 mm W/ GOOD RESULT. 
Received ASA and lipitor throughout his course. 
Briefly on integrillin gtt following catheterization , but discontinued following a retroperitoneal bleed ( see below ). 
Had recurrent CP w/ ambulation on 6/16 - isordil was held in the AM , restarted in PM.

Discharged on isrodil and toprol XL. 
Should be converted to imdur and uptitrated as necessary 2. CARDS PUMP: Hypotensive on 10/27 likely 2/2 volume depletion. 
Was orthostatic again on 10/5 AM following lasix and flomax. 
Again on 6/16 developed orthostatic hypotension after sustaining blood loss from retroperitoneal blood; not symptomatic on 4/30 Encouraged po intake and held BP medications on 6/16 AM. Recommend that flomax be held indefinitely; have restarted lasix 40 mg po qdaily at discharge ( should restart on 6/16 ). 3. CARDS RHYTHM: No active issues.

Please seek medical attention again immediately if chest pain returns. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: ( 1 ) Please restart lasix 40 mg po qdaily on 5/29 Have your PCP reeval No dictated summary ENTERED BY: MORGUSON , SHONNA A. , M.D. , PH.D. ( XP22 ) 10/16/06 @ 02 ****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******
