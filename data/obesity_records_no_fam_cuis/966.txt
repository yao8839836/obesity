932367573 | PUO | 12555338 | | 796364 | 8/27/1996 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 10/4/1996 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 11/10/1996 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Smolinsky is a 45 year old woman with hypertensive disease , as well as diabetes , who presents with sustained chest pain and shortness of breath. 
The patient has long standing obesity with moderate to severe hypertension which has been fairly well controlled and poorly controlled diabetes , as well as atypical chest pain and asthma. 
Over the last four days she has had increased episodes of rather persistent chest discomfort , shortness of breath. 
She generally describes it in her anterior chest wall as pressure , but there is also some sharp qualities as well. 
The patient has also noted increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea without subjective wheezing and there has been an increase in her orthopnea. 
The patient is unsure of whether her shortness of breath correlates with her chest pressure. 
Previous evaluation has included several negative exercise tolerance tests , but there was in 1981 an exercise tolerance test with Thallium that showed a fixed anterior profusion defect and an EKG has chronic anterolateral Q wave to poor R wave progression. 
An echo in 1991 showed LVH with no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
The patient was admitted for rule out MI three months prior to this admission. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Asthma. 2. Hypertension. 
3. Diabetes mellitus. 
4. Obesity. 5. Sleep apnea. 
6. Peptic ulcer disease. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to Codeine which produces nausea. 
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: 1. Diabetes mellitus. 
2. Hypertension. 
3. Family history of CAD. 4. No tobacco. 
5. No hypercholesterolemia. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Hysterectomy vaginally. 
2. Status post an umbilical hernia repair. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Azmacort , Proventil , Tagamet , Cardizem 300 q.day , insulin NPH 40 units q.AM and 55 units q.PM. 
, aspirin , Motrin , Maxide 1 per day , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.day. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile , heart rate 100 , respiratory rate 20 , blood pressure was 140/80 , oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. 
She was an obese black female lying in the bed at 45 degrees with nasal cannula in no acute distress. 
Her head was normocephalic atraumatic. 
Pupils were equal and round to light and accommodation. 
Her extraocular movements were full. 
Cranial nerves were intact. 
There were no oral lesions. 
There was minimal jugular venous distention. 
Chest was clear. 
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
There was no CVA tenderness. 
There was some chest wall tenderness on the left. 
The abdomen was obese and non-tender , with bowel sounds present. 
There was no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
There was no proprioceptive defects. 
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratories on admission showed her to have a potassium of 3.7 , BUN and creatinine of 11/1.2 , creatinine kinase of 148 , troponin of 0.0. 
Chest x-ray was clear with no evidence of left ventricular failure. 
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 with Q waves/poor R wave progression in I , III , IV , which was no acute change from the most recent EKG. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial CPK , as well as serial troponin , both of which showed 0.0. 
The patient also underwent a VQ scan given her sedentary life style to rule out pulmonary embolus , and in fact it was very low probability. 
The patient at that point was managed by the addition of a gastrointestinal regimen of Prilosec and Cisapride as she had complained of some worsening of her chest pressure when she laid back flat and some sour taste in her mouth. 
The patient reported that this combination of medications made her feel somewhat better. 
The patient finally underwent an exercise tolerance test with MIBI 10/1/96. 
She went 5 minutes and 0 seconds on a Bruce protocol , stopped secondary to chest pain. 
Her peak heart rate was 140 , which is 85% of predicted. 
Her systolic maximum was 120. 
The chest pressure was similar to that on admission and it was somewhat atypical and ill defined. 
The patient then had MIBI images which showed a borderline to minimal anterior reversible defect , but that was as said borderline. 
The patient was deemed suitable for discharge after conversation with Dr. Bachmann of the Cardiology Service , and the patient will be following up with her primary care doctor. 
The medication changes will be the addition of Prilosec and Cisapride in the place of Axid AND the addition of isordil 10mg po tid. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Proventil 2 puffs inhaler q.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , NPH 40 units q.AM and 55 units subcu q.PM. 
, Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.day , Maxide 1 tablet p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin 1/150 1 tablet sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.day , Azmacort 4 puffs inhaler b.i.d. , Cardizem CD 300 mg p.o. q.day , Cisapride 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. , and isordil 10 mg po tid.
