Discharge Date: ATTENDING: DOCIMO , STEFFANIE T. MD , PHD SERVICE: CCU Service. 
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease and aspirin allergy. 
LIST OF PROBLEMS: 1. Hypertension. 2. Hypercholesterolemia. 3. Atrial fibrillation. 
4. Peptic ulcer disease. 5. Colonic polyps. 
6. Prostate adenocarcinoma. 
7. Pancreatic cancer , metastatic. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wrich is a 67-year-old man with cardiac risk factors including hypertension , hypercholesterolemia. His CAD history begins one year ago when he began to experience resting jaw pain responsive to two to three sprays of nitroglycerin. 
On 5/10/05 , he presented to Petersram Medical Center with this pain and he was found to have T wave inversion , ST depressions in V6 , V1 and aVL. 
At that point , his cardiac markers peaked at troponin of 29.6. 
He was taken to the catheterization lab where he was found to have a 90% RCA stenosis. 
He underwent angioplasty and bare metal stent placement. 
After the catheterization , he had six weeks without pain but over the last two weeks he had begun to experience increasing jaw pain that was minimally responsive to nitroglycerin spray. 
He presented for elective recatheterization on 1/4 the day of his admission and was found to have 70% LAD lesion and a 40% proximal RCA lesion. 
A Cypher stent was placed in the LAD. 
He was started on Integrilin for 24 hours and sent to the CCU for aspirin desensitization. 
He has taken aspirin for headaches in his teens and developed rashes. 
He had taken aspirin a few times in his 20s and 30s without any recalled side effects. 
However , he did take 12 years ago , a dose of indomethacin and reportedly had to be inducted into a coma in the hospital for severe adverse reaction to the indomethacin. 
He cannot elaborate further on what this reaction was. 
Therefore , given the need to be on aspirin for his new Cypher stent , he was admitted to the CCU for a course of desensitization. 
PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Include Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. , captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Imdur 90 mg q.a.m. and q.p.m. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , Creon six tablets p.o. daily , Lantus 4 units subcutaneous q.h.s. , Humalog subcutaneous with meals , as needed nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. 
ALLERGIES: Include aspirin , penicillin and NSAIDs which produce rash. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco , alcohol or other drug use history. 
He lives with his wife and performs clerical work and can perform activities of daily living without issue. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.9 , pulse 87 , blood pressure 130/60 , O2 saturation 97% on room air. 
His exam was significant for being thin , fatigued man with mild icterus , mildly bleeding gums. 
JVP at 11 cm. 
III/VI harsh systolic murmur at the base. 
III/IV diastolic murmur at the base. 
His lung exam was clear bilaterally. 
His abdomen was soft , nontender with two ventral hernias without issue. 
He was alert and oriented x3 and had mild 1+ edema bilaterally. 
LABORATORY VALUES: His white count was 5.4 , hematocrit 30.2 , platelets 251 , 000. 
Creatinine was 1.2 after catheterization. 
His INR was 1.3. 
CK was 42 , troponin 0.12. 
PROCEDURES: Catheterization went without event with stenting of his LAD 70% lesion with Cypher stent. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiac. 
Mr. Botts cardiac catheterization went smoothly with identified 70% mid proximal LAD lesion and proximal 40% RCA lesion. 
A Cypher stent was placed in the LAD , and he was started on Integrelin and sent to the CCU. 
His Plavix and Imdur were continued as per his home dose. 
His beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor were held for anticipation of aspirin desensitization. 
He did not experience any further chest pain or jaw pain during his stay and was stable hemodynamically. 
2. Allergy. 
It was agreed that his aspirin should be taken given that he now has a Cypher stent. 
Given his vague history of possible aspirin allergy and question of anaphylactic shock induced by NSAIDs , it was decided to desensitize him to 81 mg of aspirin. 
This was done as per protocol defined by Allergy Consult Service with doubling increments starting at 5 mg and going to 81 mg of aspirin over the course of two hours every 30 minutes. 
Epinephrine and Benadryl were kept at bedside but were not required because he had no adverse reaction to any of the doses. 
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition on all his home medications as previously prescribed plus aspirin 81 mg each day. 
He was instructed that it was important to take his aspirin every day because if he missed a dose he may have an allergic reaction that his desensitization was designed to avoid. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. to be started one day after discharge. 
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. 3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily. 
4. Imdur 90 mg q.a.m. and q.p.m. 5. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily. 
6. Creon six tablets p.o. daily. 
7. Lantus 4 units subcutaneous q.h.s. 8. Humalog subcutaneous with meals. 
9. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual as needed. 
10. 
Aspirin 81 mg every day. 
FOLLOW UP: The patient was instructed to call the Totin Hospital And Clinic Allergy Service for outpatient appointment within two to four weeks. 
He was to contact the Onco/Allergy fellow if he experiences any itching or rash in the next few days.
