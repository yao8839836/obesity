Discharge Date: 3/8/2005 ATTENDING: HORNBEAK , LAUREL MD HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Caruth is a 65-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity , bilateral leg swelling , palpitations , remote seizure disorder last one in 1981 , obstructive sleep apnea , has started CPAP in 4/10/2005 , and migraines. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has a past surgical history of left meningioma that was diagnosed in 1987 , infection of the plate that was in his skull that was debrided in 2000 , Achilles repair in 1975 , and right knee surgery in 1965. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke. 
He rarely drinks alcohol , and denied initial drug surgery. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: His initial height was 5 feet 9-1/2 inches. 
His weight was 318 pounds on admission. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He came to Pagham University Of for an attempted lap banding on 7/30/2005 .  
Unfortunately during the surgery , there was damage to the thoracic aorta and the attempted lap banding turned into an exploratory laparotomy , median sternotomy , left thoracotomy , and aortic injury repair. 
He suffered cardiac arrest on the operating room table. 
Left hemothorax and cardiac tamponade secondary to the descending thoracic aortic laceration which was repaired intraoperatively , and his abdomen was left open temporarily with a ??____?? bag and partial VAC sponge , and he was admitted to the unit on pressors. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Notable for a couple of major events over the past couple of months , and we will go to those major events. 
On 7/25/2005 , Mr. Garness was weaned off pressors. 
On the 10/15/2005 , the mediastinal chest tube was discontinued. 
On 1/2/2005 , his creatinine started to increase. 
On 4/15/2005 and 10/12/2005 , the patient was bronched for respiratory distress with resolution of the respiratory distress. 
On 10/18/2005 , he was taken down to the operating room to increase the size of the endotracheal tube. 
His abdominal wound dehisced en route , a J tube was placed , a left triple lumen catheter was placed , and his exploratory laparotomy wound was able to be closed with wax sponge to be on top of the wound closure. 
On 4/30/2005 , he had a tap of his left chest. 
There was fluid collection there from the left thoracotomy. 
On 8/8/2005 , the left chest tube was placed and on 1/11/2005 , a left chest tube was discontinued. 
On 2/7/2005 , he was trached and two chest tubes were placed and a left VATS was completed again , because of a persisted fluid collection. 
On 4/24/2005 , a right PICC was placed and the triple lumen and his A line were discontinued. 
On 6/10/2005 , a TEE was done that showed normal valves with no vegetations and no major regional wall motion abnormalities. 
On 9/30/2005 , his trach was changed to a #7. 
On 2/10/3005 , his trach was changed to a #8 Portex. 
On 11/28/2005 , he had a renal ultrasound for again a slowly rising creatinine that did not show any evidence of hydronephrosis. 
On 3/23/2005 , CVVH was started after Quinton was placed in the right IJ , on 5/4/2005 , his #8 Portex trach was replaced with a #8 Shiley. 
On 10/18/2205 , a clot developed in the CVVH catheter. 
On 1/25/2005 , a wound which was being seen periodically by I&amp;D has had periodic wound I&amp;Ds and VAC changes. 
On 6/23/2005 , the right IJ Quinton was discontinued and a right IJ tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed. 
On 2/7/2005 , he had a metabolic heart and began to trach collar for increasing amounts of time. 
On 9/20/2005 and 12 , there was report that his J tube had been slightly displaced and then had been pushed in by the ICU team. 
The patient developed left lower quadrant pain. 
He was sent down for the CT of the abdomen and pelvis , and now the J tube was not fully visualized I think because it is radiolucent to extravasation of contrast was not seen and surgery team felt that it was okay to continue tube feeds safely which we have with no problems. 
On 6/16/2005 , he desaturated when he went down for an ultrasound for the left upper extremity in order to rule out clot because again the left upper extremity had been swelling , so no studies was completed. 
He developed rigor short after with the temperature to 104 , some mild hypotension and tachycardia. 
TEE at the bedside show no dissection or intimal flap blood cultures were drawn. 
His PICC was discontinued and the tip was sent for culture , and he received doses of levofloxacin and vancomycin. 
He was able to eventually J-collar through this. 
On 3/26/2005 , a 3 out of 4 gram negative rods which ended up being enterobacter were cultured out. 
We believe that he suffered a transient bacteremia from the PICC. 
Levofloxacin was started and ID was consulted because the enterobacter was resistant about everything except amikacin and imipenem. 
On 10/3/2005 , allergy was also consulted and restarted an imipenem desensitization process which he has completed , and he is now on imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours for a total course of 15 days that was started on 10/3/2005 , and a PICC was replaced. 
Today , he was planning to go to hemodialysis in order to exchange the dialysis catheter over wire not that it is not functioning but because of this transient bacteremia we would like to give them a new hemodialysis catheter. 
He has been able to get hemodialysis with , though some 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 units of heparin has to be given beforehand in order for the catheters to flush well , and he will also be going for left upper extremity either ultrasound or venogram to again rule out a clot in the left upper extremity due to the increased swelling. 
His last temperature here is 98.3 today. 
His blood pressure runs systolics 90 to 110 with a heart rate in the 90s to 110s. 
He is on no drips or IV fluids , just his full strength Nepro of 55 which is his goal and he is essentially anuric , but when we do straight caths which we tend to do once every 1-2 days , he puts out usually 100-200 cc of urine and he has been J-collaring successfully now for over three or four days saturations in the 95% to 100% and an FiO2 of 40%. 
OT and PT have also been seeing him. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Neurologically , his mental status has much improved. 
He had initially some ICU delirium after the initial surgery that has really greatly improved. 
He right now is on no major mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. 
We do give him oxycodone for pain , which he really has had to use. 
Pulmonarywise , we have kept him on J-collar when he does need to go for a procedure we do send down the vent in case just because he is still fairly large person and may need the ventilatory support for positioning. 
He is right now on Combivent and DuoNeb nebulizers p.r.n. 
Cardiovascularwise , his blood pressure has been stable and so has his tachycardia. 
The beta-blocker that he was initially on Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. was stopped secondary to the imipenem desensitization the feeling being that if he did has an anaphylactic reaction , the epinephrine needed unopposed action and we did not want any beta-blocker on board. 
We have held and would continue it starting at a low dose after he completes his course of imipenem. 
Gastrointestinalwise , he is on tube feeds which he tolerates very well and there are no issues any more with the J-tube position. 
We are requesting a bedside speech and swallow official consult , though he has been tolerating ice chips and ice cream with absolutely no problems on p.o. He is also on Pepcid IV for GI prophylaxis. 
Genitourinarywise , he gets hemodialysis every other day. 
They have been taking 4-5 liters per day and again with straight catheterizing once every 1-2 days and usually get about a 100 cc to 200 cc of urine. 
Renal has been following him , and they are unhappy with his course of dialysis. 
Again , the hemodialysis catheter is to be wire exchanged today , which is 11/5/2005 , but again they have been able to use it just fine so far. 
Hematologywise , he is on heparin subcutaneous 10 , 000 units t.i.d. 
Endocrinewise , we have been checking his fingersticks and he is right now on Lantus 15 units subcutaneous b.i.d. with a sliding scale for coverage. 
He has just been following the fingersticks that way and imipenem , he is to continue for 14-day course total of imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours. 
The first dose was given in the a.m. on 10/3/2005 , and there are no new culture results after the gram-negative enterobacter was found. 
All other surveillance and urine culture have been negative.
