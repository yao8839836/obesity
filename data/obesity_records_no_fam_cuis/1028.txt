CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Fritze is a 70-year-old woman with a history of yellow nail syndrome , hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes , who has had multiple admissions since October 2001. 
The first was an admission to an outside hospital from 5/25/01 - 11/20/01. 
At that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and was diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial effusion. 
She had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drained from her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. 
She was discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure , secondary to cor pulmonale. 
The second admission was from 8/28/01 - 8/10/01 at the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of . 
At that time , she had increased lower extremity edema. 
She was diuresed during that admission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. 
An echocardiogram at that time revealed mild LVH , an ejection fraction of 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-large pericardial effusion with fibrinous strands. 
A catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , an RV pressure of 45/11 , PA pressures of 38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , LV pressure was 127/14. 
There was no constrictive pericardial disease or restrictive cardiomyopathy. 
She also had no malignant cells in her pleural effusion , which was exudated. 
ANCA , ANA , SPEP were negative. 
She also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass or hydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein. 
The third admission was at Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of from 11/15/01 - 1/16/01 , for increasing shortness of breath and increasing lower extremity edema. 
At that time she was diuresed , found to be iron deficient. 
She had bilateral thoracentesis , which revealed exudative effusions. 
PFTs revealed a FEV1 of .9 , 40% of predicted , an FVC of 1.26 , 43% of predicted , an FEV1/FVC ratio of 93% , a TLC of 2.07 , 40% of predicted , and a DLCO of 8.42 , also 40% of predicted. 
She was ruled out for TB with serial ASBs during this admission. 
She was also diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome at that time , consisting of the clinical syndrome of recurrent pleural effusions , lymphedema and yellow fingernails. 
She was started on high dose Vitamin E , and evaluated by CT surgery for a possible pleurodesis. 
However , she was sent home at that time with an increased dose of diuretics. 
Since her discharge in July , she has been aggressively diuresed , but the diuretics were stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. 
In September 2001 , she was found to have a 10 pound weight gain and was restarted on Lasix. 
Over the week prior to admission , she has had increasing dyspnea on exertion. 
She has baseline shortness of breath and orthopnea , but her orthopnea has also worsened. 
Her weight at discharge in July was 208 , and on admission she currently weighs 238 , and was 231 pounds a month prior to admission. 
She denies wheezing , but does have a chronic cough with white sputum. 
She has had some substernal chest pain that is sharp with dyspnea on exertion , which lasts for awhile without radiation. 
She also has increasing lower extremity edema. 
In the emergency department , she was found to be afebrile , heart rate 103 , respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure 95/41 and satting 91% on 2 liters. 
She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebs without improvement and Lasix 160 mg IV with a 600 cc diuresis.

SUMMARY: This is a 70-year-old woman with history of hypertension , diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , home 02 requirement and yellow nail syndrome. 
She was admitted with increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain over the past week prior to admission. 
She has most likely had a failure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tapped along with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome in terms of recurrent pleural effusions. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Pulmonary. 
We initially diuresed Ms. Fritze with IV Lasix , along with Diuril. 
She had brisk diuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. 
On hospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and were able to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. 
The fluid was sent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as an exudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. 
The cytology was negative for any malignant cells. 
The pulmonary team was consulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis to prevent effusions from recurring. 
We consulted thoracic surgery , who requested a CT scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungs for evidence of malignancy. 
CT scan was done on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and having to do the study without IV contrast , there were areas in her right and left lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have been malignancies. 
CT surgery also requested cardiac clearance before any definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset SVT. 
We obtained a stress MIBI. 
On 9/4/01 , she was taken to the operating room for surgery of the right chest. 
At that time , Dr. Finseth , the cardiothoracic surgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedly thickened and yellow. 
She also took a wedge biopsy of the right lower lobe. 
Those biopsies have returned , and revealed mild nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis. 
The diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoid tissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. 
She had a chest tube placed at the time of operation and tolerated that well. 
However , after that procedure , she was deemed unstable by the PACU team and was admitted to MICU overnight. 
She extubated without problems and remained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygen saturations in the 90%. 
She was readmitted to the medicine team on the following day , 8/28/01. 
Overall , she tolerated that procedure well. 
Her chest tube that was placed on the right side did not drain much fluid over the next few days. 
However , the pleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we did a thoracentesis on 8/28/01. 
We removed 1 liter of turbid , yellowish brown fluid. 
The chemistries revealed a lymphocyte and macrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at this time. 
As her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracic surgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which has shown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% of the time. 
The pleurodesis was on 3/29/01. 
She tolerated this procedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48 hours. 
The chest tube was pulled on 6/2/01. 
Mrs. Fritze 's shortness of breath was much improved after the initial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on her home oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. 
The plan is for her to see Dr. Finseth in 2 weeks and also have a follow-up chest x-ray. 
At that time , Dr. Finseth will determine if there is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis. 
She can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initial pleurodesis on the left. 
2. Cardiovascular. 
Mrs. Fritze was tachycardic on admission , and continued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. 
She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix and Diuril , and was probably over diuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight. 
On hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates in the 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. 
She converted back to normal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of IV calcium channel blockers and a Diltiazem drip. 
She was then maintained on Diltiazem SR 60 mg PO b.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinus rhythm. 
However , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal HL tachycardia during her MICU admission. 
At the time of admission , we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. 
She had a bedside echocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed a trace pericardial effusion. 
She also had a dobutamine MIBI for cardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. 
Her heart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreased from 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. 
The clinical response to dobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response was normal , and the EKG response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. 
There were no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or rest images. 
However , only planer images could be obtained , due to difficulty with positioning of the patient's left arm. 
Her results were determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence of hemodynamically secondary CAD , although the study was technically limited. 
In terms of her diuresis , Ms. Fritze was kept on IV Lasix for only the first few days of her admission , and then was switched to PO diuretics. 
Initially at a dose of 200 mg PO b.i.d. , and then decreased to 120 mg PO b.i.d. 
Her lower extremity edema decreased significantly , along with her pleural effusions. 
3. Renal. 
Ms. Fritze 's baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatinine throughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. 
We caused a mild contraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete her electrolytes as needed. 
She will follow with Dr. Spillett for her renal insufficiency as an outpatient. 
4. Endocrine. 
Ms. Fritze has type II diabetes and was on glyburide 5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. 
She continued that therapy as an inpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during this admission. 
5. Rheumatology. 
Ms. Fritze has a history of gout , and we were concerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressive diuresis. 
We continued her colchicine and decreased her allopurinol to 200 mg PO q. d. 
We also continued her Vitamin E therapy for the yellow nail syndrome. 
6. Hematology. 
She has chronic anemia , and we continued her iron and Procrit treatment during the admission. 
DISPOSITION: Ms. Fritze will be discharged to home with VNA services to administer her twice weekly Procrit doses , and physical therapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion in her joints infected with gout. 
She has been instructed to make follow-up appointments with Dr. Finseth in a few weeks , and to have a chest x-ray on the day that she sees Dr. Felts She should also follow-up with Dr. Spillett in the renal clinic.
