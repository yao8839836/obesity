CC: bilateral foot pain , sob , palpitations HPI: 35 F with CKD IV/V ( renal: Kisielewski ) 2/2 minimal change dz was in USOH until 6 days PTA when developed bilateral foot pain typical of gout flare. 
5 days PTA developed SOB and heart racing which was constant. 
Attributed sx to prednisone and stopped prednisone 3 days PTA. 
Yet SOB and sensation of rapid heart rhythm continued. 
She had never had the sensation before and has no h/o tachyarrhythmia. 
On DOA , she came to ED for evalulation of her bilateral gouty foot pain and was found to be tachycardic to 150 bpm. 
EKG notable for narrow complex tachycardia ( SVT/likely AVNRT. ) . 
IN ED: given adenosine 6 mg IV x 1 with conversion to NSR for less than a minutes , and then reversion back to SVT. 
She responded to additional adenosine 12 mg IV x 1 and reverted to SR for the remainder of her hospital stay. 
PMH: CKD IV/V 2/2 minimal change dz with left UE AVF in prep for likely future HD , gout , sickle cell trait , anemia , HTN , h/o PE s/p coumadin , morbid obesity ALLERGIES: PCN , ampicillin-&gt;hives. Procardia-&gt;h/a .

low probability . 
35F with h/o CKD IV/V 2/2 minimal change dz who presents with 6 days of DOE , heart racing shortly after starting prednisone for bilateral foot pain 2/2 gout. 
Found to be in SVT with rate to 150 bpm. 
Initially , high suspicion of PE , given h/o PE , evolution of pleuritic chest pain , and SVT. 
LENI's were negative. 
She was empirically started on heparin IV. 
Yet on HD2 , she had a V/Q scan with NO perfusion defect and heparin was discontinued. 
The precipitating event leading to SVT was not determined. 
No PE or evidence of ischemic event. 
However , she had multiple metabolic derangements , especially hyocalcemia ( Ca 6.0 , iCa 0.79 , Mg. 1.6 ) as well as evidence worsening structural heart disease and evolving cardiomyopathy. 
Her SVT resolved after adenosine 12 mg IV x 1 and she remained in SR during the rest of hospital stay. 
ECHO showed EF 40% , diastolic dysfunction and LVH likely 2/2 longstanding HTN. 
This was a change from ECHO in 2002 when she had nl EF 60% , no e/o diastolic dysfunction and no ventricular enlargement. 
The cause of her new cardiomyopathy is possibly HTN and concern raised for high-output state due increase flow thru AV fistula. 
We discussed the case briefly with the vascular surg service. 
There is no definitive test to determine if flow throught the aVF is too great. 
This may need to be discussed between her primary renal doctors and vascular. 
. 
HYPOCALCEMIA: VitD level pending , PTH dramatically elevated at 914. 
Noted to have elevated QTc of QTC 504 msec in setting hypocalcemia. 
Calcitriol was increased and calcium citrate was initiated. 
Calcium was also repleted with calcium gluconate boluses and magnesium supplementation. 
Ionized calcium was followed. 
She is being discharged home on Calcium citrate bid , calcitriol 2mcg qd , and prior dose of ergocalciferol. 
. 
CODE: FULL ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted after experiencing a rapid heart rhythm that normalized after treatment with medicine. 
There is no clear explanation for why you went into this abnormal rhythm , there are a few possibilities. 
These include disturbances in your electrolytes , such as very low calcium , as low as changes in your heart from high blood pressure and fluid retention. 
You did not have a clot to your lungs or in your legs. 
You were started on calcium supplements ( calcium citrate ) , calcitriol dose was increased. 
Metoprolol dose was increased to treat your high blood pressure. . 
KEY MEDICINE CHANGES: 1. Increase metoprolol dose 2. Increase calcitriol dose 3. Start calcium citrate: takes this medicine BETWEEN meals , as it will be less effective if taken with meals. 
4. It is important that you take all prescribed medicines to keep your heart healthy and to make sure your electrolytes and calcium stay in acceptable limits. 
If you have problems filling your medicines , please notifiy your primary or renal doctors. 
. 
Contact a physician or return to the emergency room if you develop recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , sensation of rapid heart rhythm that does not go away after a few minutes or comes on with breathing problems or chest pain. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: 1. Check metabolic panel , including calcium. 
2. F/u on vitamin D level ( pending at d/c ) 3. Check BP on elevated dose metoprolol ER No dictated summary ENTERED BY: YEAGLEY , MA , M.D. ( VE850 ) 10/10/07 @ 12 ****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******
