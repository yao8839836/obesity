Discharge Date: 10/5/2006 ATTENDING: KERTESZ , ALETA M.D. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Aortic valve stenosis. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 75-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease who is status post CABG in 1983 who has recently experienced unstable angina and was admitted in April of 2006 to Sertneervilleall Rop Fortchoc Health Care for workup and was found to have an aortic valve area of 0.8 and significant vein graft disease to OM1. 
The patient received coronary stents to OM1 and the native circumflex at Ouf County General Hospital in April of 2006. 
Of note , the right coronary artery was seen to be occluded at that time as was the vein graft to that coronary. 
The vein graft to the LAD had been priorly stented and was noted to be patent. 
The patient began developing shortness of breath and symptoms of aortic stenosis , which were complicated by anemia , which was thought to have developed due to some AV malformations of the foregut. 
In view of the patient's progressive symptoms , it was decided to proceed with aortic valve replacement , which was first scheduled for September , but then rescheduled when the patient was noted to have coughing and hemoptysis. 
The patient was treated for pneumonia surgery rescheduled and he is admitted to Pagham University Of for reoperation aortic valve replacement. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , gout , GERD , congestive heart failure , anemia and BPH. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Prostate surgery , left hip replacement , right total knee replacement , cholecystectomy and tonsillectomy. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: A 60-pack-year smoking history , two glasses of wine every evening. 
The patient is a widower , lives alone , four children live in the area. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily. 
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily. 
3. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily. 
4. Atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily. 
5. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily. 
6. Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily. 
7. Multivitamin. 
8. Iron daily. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 5 feet 6 inches tall , 82 kg , temperature 96 , heart rate 70 , blood pressure 124/60 and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. 
HEENT , PERRLA. 
Oropharynx benign. 
Neck without carotid bruits. 
Chest with a midline sternotomy. 
Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , systolic ejection murmur. 
Respiratory , breath sounds clear bilaterally. 
Abdomen , cholecystectomy scar well-healed , soft , no masses. 
Extremities without scarring , varicosities or edema , 2+ pedal and radial pulses bilaterally. 
Allen's test in both upper extremities normal by pulse oximeter. 
Neuro , alert and oriented , grossly nonfocal exam. 
LABORATORY DATA: Preop laboratory chemistries include BUN of 21 and creatinine of 0.8. White blood cell count is 5.8 , hematocrit 35 and INR is 1.0. 
Carotid imaging , left internal carotid artery 1 to 25% occluded , right internal carotid artery 25% to 49% occluded. 
Cardiac catheterization data from 2/29/06 performed at outside hospital reveals the following: 60% left main , 100% RCA , 100% mid LAD , 100% SVG1 to LAD , 100% SVG3 to circumflex. 
There is borderline LV function. 
Estimated ejection fraction is 35%. 
There is inferior hypokinesia , global hypokinesia , vein graft occlusion of 100% to the right coronary artery , widely patent saphenous graft , inside of prior standing to OM1 and OM2 , widely patent saphenous vein graft to the LAD , patent prior stents placed in native LAD and left main. 
Echo from 2/29/06 estimates ejection fraction of 55% , finds aortic valve stenosis with mean gradient of 53 mmHg and a peak gradient of 82 mmHg and calculated valve area of 0.8 cm2 , mild aortic valve insufficiency , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid insufficiency , aortic valve was thickened with diminished cusp mobility. 
The left atrium is enlarged. 
There is mitral annular calcification , normal mitral leaflet excursion. 
Left ventricle demonstrates concentric hypertrophy. 
There is normal right systolic function. 
Right atrium is dilated. 
Right ventricle is normal. 
Tricuspid valve was normal. 
There is severe aortic valve stenosis. 
EKG , normal sinus rhythm at 68 with ST elevations in V1 and V2 , inverted Ts in leads 1 , 2 , AVF , AVR , AVL and V1 through V6. Chest x-ray is normal , but reveals aortic calcification. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on 4/29/06 and underwent reoperation minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve. 
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit following surgery on Levophed and epinephrine drips. 
He was noted to be hypotensive following surgery , which was refractory to pressors and volume requiring pressor boluses and transient application of chest compressions and the patient underwent placement of an intraaortic balloon pump. 
The balloon pump was weaned and removed by postoperative day 2 and pressors were weaned by postoperative day 3. The patient transferred to the Step-Down Unit later on postoperative day #3 and continued to progress daily. 
His diet was advanced to full house diet and was well tolerated. 
The patient was started on beta-blockade , aspirin and statin for his coronary artery disease and a course of antibiotics was completed for a preoperative urinary tract infection The patient was followed perioperatively by the Diabetes Management Service for tight glycemic control. 
The patient was weaned off of supplemental oxygen with ongoing diuresis and he remained in sinus rhythm and saturated well on room air for the remainder of his stay. 
The patient's preoperative Flomax was restarted following the removal of Foley catheter. 
The patient initially had difficulty voiding and then voided without difficulty. 
He has been instructed to follow up with his home neurologist within the next few weeks and earlier if he has difficulties. 
The remainder of his postoperative stay was uncomplicated and he is discharged to Rehab in good condition on postoperative day #6. 
At time of discharge , laboratory chemistries include the following , sodium of 135 , potassium of 4.3 , BUN of 18 and creatinine of 0.8. White blood cell count is 5.7 , hematocrit 27.5 and INR is 1.1. 
He is discharged to Rehab on the following medications. 
1. Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. daily. 
2. Oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o. q.6 h. 
p.r.n. pain. 
3. Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4. Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily. 
5. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily. 
6. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.

The patient will follow up appointments with his cardiologist , Dr. Dominguez in one to two weeks and with his cardiac surgeon , Dr. Kertesz in four to six weeks. 
He will also follow up with his urologist , Dr. Trelles in three to four weeks.
