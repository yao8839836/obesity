An EKG on 5/27/06 showed first-degree AV block with a heart rate of 62 and inverted T waves in leads I , aVL and V4 through V6. Chest x-ray on 7/6/06 was consistent with congestive heart failure and revealed aortic calcifications and left lower lobe atelectasis. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 7/6/06 for completion of his preoperative workup. 
He was brought to the operating room on 10/22/06 where Dr. Golebiowski performed a reoperative sternotomy and a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement using a 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve. 
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 186 minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 77 minutes. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. 
Over the next few days , the patient was extubated. 
He had episodes of uncontrolled hypertension and was placed on a nitroglycerin drip. 
By postoperative day #4 , the patient had been weaned off his drips and his blood pressure was well controlled. 
He had been hemodynamically stable and afebrile in the Intensive Care Unit. 
He was ready for transfer to the regular hospital floor for the remainder of his recovery. 
At that point , the patient demonstrated postoperative confusion , particularly at night. 
The patient's neurological exam was otherwise normal. 
The patient was started on cardiac medications including captopril , Lopressor and aspirin. 
He had been extubated without complication and was oxygenating well with the support of 1 liter of oxygen via nasal cannula.
