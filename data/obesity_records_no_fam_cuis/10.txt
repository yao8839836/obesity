HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease , hypertension and chronic pain , admitted with chest pain. 
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , increased cholesterol , positive family history and history of coronary artery disease. 
She has a history of Q wave myocardial infarction with right ventricular infarct in October 1992. 
Peak CK's were 2300. 
Catheterization showed 100% RCA lesion which was treated with angioplasty reduced to 20-30% stenosis. 
The patient had chest pain the succeeding months and had two catheterizations showing no change in her coronary arteries. 
Echocardiogram showed an LVEF of 50%. 
Subsequent catheterization October 92 , July 92 and September 92 for atypical chest pain , showed clean coronaries. 
Exercise tread mill test in September 92 , the patient went three minutes and 31 seconds with standard Bruce protocol and stopped secondary to atypical chest pain. 
Maximum heart rate 162 , blood pressure 176/90 , no ST or T wave changes. 
In April 92 she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and EKG , after presenting with prolonged chest pain. 
VQ scan was low probability. 
Chest CT ruled out aortic dissection. 
The patient was referred to the Pain Service. 
In February 1993 the patient had additional sharp chest pain , again ruled out for myocardial infarction , was seen by the Pain Services and discharged on trazodone and Relafen plus cardiac medicines. 
The patient now presents to the hospital with 24 hours of right sided chest pain , stating that it was squeezing in her right breast , felt to be between the shoulder blades. 
She took two sublingual Nitroglycerin the day before admission and three on the morning of admission without relief. 
She complained of shortness of breath , dizziness , weakness and nausea , no palpitations were noted. 
The pain was not worse with positional changes. 
The patient is seen in the Stusri Medical Center emergency room where she received two sublingual Nitroglycerins which reduced her pain from 7/10 to 1/10 level. 
She also received 10 mg IV Morphine , 725 mg IV Lopressor , two inches Nitro Paste and two liters of oxygen. 
The pain was intermittent through the rest of the day. 
She had no fever , chills , cough , she did complain of urinary frequency , chronic left back pain and right lower extremity pain.

The pain is not reproducible by palpation. 
Extremities , 1+ edema of the lower extremities with preserved peripheral pulses. 
LABORATORY DATA: Cholesterol 226. 
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of 90 beats per minute , normal intervals , left ventricular hypertrophy. 
There were T wave inversions in Leads I , V2 , V6 , bisphasic T waves V5 , flat waves V3 , V4 , left atrial enlargement. 
Compared with the examination of 2/7/93 T wave inversions were less deep in V3 through V5. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial EKG and enzymes. 
Her blood pressure was initially poorly controlled and she was placed on a regimen of Aldomet 750 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lopressor 150 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Nifedipine XL 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
On 11/28/93 the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed normal coronary arteries , mildly elevated pulmonary pressure of 40/24 and mean of 30 , capillary wedge pressure of 14 mm mercury. 
On the afternoon of 5/10 the patient had 600 mg of Levatol and two hours later complained of light-headedness with a systolic blood pressure in the 80's. 
This gradually increased to greater than 110 systolic so the patient was placed in Trendelenburg position and received 400 cc's of IV fluids.
