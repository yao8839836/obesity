Discharge Date: 11/15/1998 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Vercher is a 68 year old female with known heart murmur since the 1950s. 
She has a been closely followed since approximately 1990 for multi-valve disease. 
In early February of 1998 she presented with chest pressure and was seen at Pagham University Of for cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant coronary artery disease but markedly increased filling pressures. 
Her right atrial pressure was 14/16/10. 
Right ventricular pressure was 75/100 , pulmonary artery pressure was 75/35/50 and her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 32/36/30. 
Echocardiogram on 3/16/98 , revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mildly decreased systolic function with an ejection fraction of 45 percent , normal right ventricular size and function , moderate mitral stenosis and three plus mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency and aortic stenosis , three plus tricuspid regurgitation and a dilated inferior vena cava. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for rheumatic fever , hypothyroidism , borderline diabetes mellitus , atrial fibrillation , breast cancer for which she had radiation therapy. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a right lumpectomy in the 1990s. 
She has had an appendectomy in 1993 and a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in the past. 
ALLERGIES: Penicillin ( causes rash and itch ). 
PHYSICAL EXAM: Unremarkable. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Vercher was brought to the operating room on 4/6/98 where she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #19 St. Jude valve , a mitral valve replacement with a #27 St. Jude valve and a tricuspid valvuloplasty with a DeVega annuloplasty. 
The patient intraoperatively was found to have a tricuspid valve with a dilated annulus but normal leaflets. 
Transient right ventricular dysfunction requiring epinephrine and nitroglycerin. 
The patient came off of bypass and was paced. 
The patient went back into atrial fibrillation. 
The patient was brought up to the intensive care unit in stable condition. 
Ms. Vercher was extubated on postoperative day number one. 
She was noted to have bradycardia postoperatively which required pacing and she was found to have no significant underlying rhythm. 
She was seen by the electrophysiology service who had suggested we continue following her and hope to find a recurrence of her AV node function. 
She was discharged to the step-down unit on postoperative day number two. 
She was found to have an intrinsic rhythm of atrial fibrillation with a left bundle branch block with a heart rhythm of 55-65. 
Ms. Vercher continued in atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 80s and was able to come off of her external pacemaker. 
The patient was started on Dextran to augment anticoagulation which increased her INR for discharge planning. 
She will be discharged to home in stable condition. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Coumadin as directed; Captopril 25 mg q 8h , Digoxin 01.25 mg q day , Colace 100 mg three times a day: Levoxil 50 mcg once a day , Lasix 80 mg once a day , potassium chloride 40 mg once a day. 
LABORATORY DATA AT DISCHARGE: On 3/29/98 , her glucose was 112 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.9 , sodium 133 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 99 , C02 of 25 , magnesium of 2.4 , digoxin level was 0.6. 
White blood cells 10.6 , hemoglobin 11.4 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 319 , PT 18.3 , INR of 2.3. 
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: Ms. Vercher will be discharged to home in stable condition with visiting nurse. 
She will follow up with her cardiologist in the next 1-2 weeks and Dr. Golebiowski in the next six weeks.
