ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Hypovolemia and fatigue. 
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , and 2+ mitral regurgitation. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Weakness. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post silent MI and cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , who has a longstanding history of severe anxiety and presented with fatigue and shortness of breath. 
On the day of admission , the patient took an extra dose of Lasix because he thought that he might be fluid overloade. 
In the emergency room , it was thought that he appeared dry and he was admitted for volume resuscitation. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , silent MI in 1998 , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease with GI bleed , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction previously reported at 20% in October 2005 , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 20 mg to 40 mg daily , aspirin 325 daily , Lipitor 5 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 daily , Valium 5 mg t.i.d. p.r.n. , Accupril 5 mg daily and Aleve p.r.n. 
ALLERGIES: Sulfa causes rash and ciprofloxacin causes hallucinations. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an Irish descendent. 
He lives alone with many cats. 
Drinks occasional ethanol , no tobacco or illicit drugs. 
He is retired. 
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 95.6 , heart rate 112 , blood pressure 153/90 with orthostasis , respiratory rate 18 , 97% oxygen on room air.

Neuro: The patient was oriented. 
Cranial nerves III through XII intact. 
Strength is 5/5 throughout. 
The sensation was intact throughout. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: 1. Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient appeared dry and was resuscitated with one liter of IV fluids. 
The patient's Lasix was held initially on admission. 
On hospital day #2 , he was looking well. 
His weight was 151 pounds which was suspected to be close to his dry weight which was reportedly 149 pounds. 
By 8/18/05 , he was restarted on 20 mg of Lasix daily so that he would stay euvolemic. 
He received intermittent IV Lasix ( 20mg ) throughout the remainder of his hospitalization and his p.o. Lasix dose was settled on 40 mg p.o. daily. 
His captopril was restarted on the 9/19/05 at 6.25 mg t.i.d. 
He tolerated that dose and was switched to Accupril 2.5 mg b.i.d. 
He underwent an echocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetation on the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. 
This question of a vegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and blood culture were sent. 
The patient's temperature had been low on admission , since there was some concern that he could be developing sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood cultures throughout the remainder of his hospitalization. 
He was seen by Cardiology , who did not think that this echo result required further intervention and suspected that it represented a flail tricuspid valve leaflet. 
The patient's troponin One troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and then another troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting ARF and acute hepatitis. 
He recently had a negative stress echo at the Greene Lidonimill Medical Center , so no additional stress testing was pursued during this admission. 
He was switched to Lopressor 25 t.i.d. and then switched back to Toprol XL. His statin was discontinued during the admission because of LFT abnormalities which will be discussed below. 
He was monitored on telemetry which demonstrated frequent PVCs and some NSVT. 
This should be readdressed in Cardiology Clinic. 
Cardiology decided to hold off on placing an AICD and was to see him as an outpt. 
2. GI/renal: On the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient developed new confusion and delirium. 
He also developed an oxygen requirement the night before. 
His labs on morning were notable for a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( WBC 9 to 25 ). 
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage for bartonella as he had many cats. 
He was empirically started on mucomyst and acyclovir as per GI in case his LFT abnormalities were due to tylenol toxicity or HSV. 
He was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this was cancelled as his LFTs started to normalize. 
He had a RUQ with dopplers which was negative. 
The etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis was never identified throughout the admission. 
Cardiology did not think that any of this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stopped once his cultures were negative for multiple days. 
GI though he could of had shock liver but he was on telemetry the entire time. 
His tylenol level was normal and his hep seriologies were negative. 
His labs had all normalized by admission except for his LFTs which were still trending downward. 
3. Infectious disease: Due to low temperature and question of vegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsis although that never panned out. 
He has a history of feeding stray cats and so bartonella cultures were sent. 
They take a long time to come back and should be followed up as outpatient. 
He had been placed on antibiotics while awaiting cultures but those were discontinued on the 8/18/05 as the microbiology data remains negative. 
He had a CT scan of his chest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. 
He had ground glass opacities on his CT chest which were felt to be due to CHF when reviewed with the radiologist. 
He remained afebrile during the admission. 
4. Psych: Early on during the patient's admission , he did have several episodes of tachypnea at rest. 
They were not positional in nature and resolved with verbal consolation and redirection and deep breath. 
No associated desaturation at that time. 
The patient has a history of anxiety and reported that that prompted him to increase his Lasix dose at home. 
He refused psychiatric consultation or social work involvement. 
His Valium had initially been initiated but it was held in the setting of abnormal LFTs. 
He had no further anxiety attacks after that. 
It is likely that he has mild baseline dementia. 
His delirium resolved after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolved. 
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient had a little bit of difficulty ambulating and was seen by Physical Therapy who did think that further physical therapy would be appropriate. 
The patient refused to go to rehabilitation facility , so he was planning to go home with services including physical therapy at home. 
6. Hematology: The patient was set to go home and then it was noted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady decline throughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/Lovenox. 
There was concern that this could represent heparin induced thrombocytopenia and so all heparin products were stopped. 
He was placed lepirudin which was chosen instead of Argatroban because Argatroban was cleared by liver in light of his hepatitis. 
His initial PF4 was read as bordeline positive , but the laber later changed the result to negative. 
Based on this discrepancy another PF4 was sent which was borderline positive. 
As per the hematology consult , they felt that despite the borderline positive PF4 he did not need prophylactic anticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in the future until a repeat PF4 in checked in a few months. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 mg daily , Accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mg daily. 
DIET: Low sodium. 
ACTIVITY: As tolerated with supervision and advised by the physical therapist. 
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Ramil is the patient's new PCP at the KTDUOO clinic at the Pagham University Of , he has an appointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with Dr. Catania was made from Cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m. ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Do not take Valium or Lipitor until you are cleared by your doctor to do so due to liver function. 
Weigh yourself daily and keep a record and bring that to follow up appointment. 
If you develop light headedness , shortness of breath , chest pain or any other symptoms you are concerned about , call your doctor or return to the Pagham University Of emergency room for evaluation.
