RENAL: *ARF* Original ddx included prerenal ( decreased PO intake , glucosuria ) vs. renal ( URI --&gt; glomerulonephritis ) vs. postrenal ( mass , clots --&gt; B obstruction ... but no hydronephrosis ). 
Cr came down from 5.3 to near nl w/ hydration suggesting prerenal etiology. 
Urine examined under microscope was without red blood cell casts. 
On presentation , pt. had no acute indication for dialysis. 
He was not uremic , had no rub , had good urine output , had mild acedemia , and had normal K. As noted , his Cr came down to near normal with hydration. 
*bladder mass* A bladder mass surrounded by blood clots was identified on the patient's admission CT. Due to conern for bladder cancer , urine cytology was sent. 
Results are pending. 
On 8/19 , the urology team performed a cystoscopy which revealed a large bladder stone surrounded by hemorrhage. 
The clot was evacuated and the stone was broken up by electrohydraulic lithotripsy. 
Biopsy samples were taken from the inflamed bladder wall. 
Pathology results are pending. 
A 3-way foley catheter was placed and continuous bladder irrigation was initiated. 
The patient received peri-procedure antibiosis with ancef and gent. 
The large size of the bladder stone suggests urinary retension , perhaps due to persistent BPH ( despite 2000 TURP ). 
The patient was started on flomax and proscar , as recommended by the urology team. 
The patient was discharged with a foley catheter in place. 
He will return to PUO urology clinics on 10/22 for a voiding trial. 
CV: pump *HTN* In house , pt. was treated with norvasc and lopressor. 
He was discharged on norvasc and toprol XL. Ace inhibition was not initiated due to the patient's renal insufficiency. 
*murmur* On exam , pt. had a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the R and L upper sternal border and radiating to the carotids. 
An ECHO revealed a preserved ejection fraction of 65% , no RWMA , nl diastolic function , normal RV size and function , nl LA and RA size , and mild AS with a valve area of 1.4. 
The patient is not symptomatic from his AS , by history. 
He denies syncope , chest pain , orthopnea , PND , or LE edema. 
rhythm: NSR ischemia: *CAD* Pt. reported no chest pain. 
His admission EKG showed new inferior/lateral ST-T changes. 
Cardiac markers revealed CK 330 , CKMB 7.5 , and Tn I&lt;assay. 
His EKG changes could represent old infarct ( although ECHO showed no RWMA ) or could represent demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension and anemia. 
Pt. was treated with a bblocker , as above. 
Pt was not treated with ASA given his hematuria , but such therapy may be started on an outpatient basis. 
Pt. was not treated with an acei due to his creatinine , but such therapy , too , may be started on an outpatient basis. 
Pt. may also benefit from outpt. 
stress testing. 
Lipids profile showed cholesterol 156 , triglycerides 119 , HDL 39 , LDL 93. GI: *reflux* Pt. was treated with nexium and mylanta PRN. 
He was maintained on a cardiac , diabetic diet. 
ENDO: *new DM , most likely type II* On admission pt. had a small anion gap , mild elevation of +B-hydroxybutyrate , and +ketones in his urine. 
With hydration , his gap closed. 
The ketoacidosis was likely from starvation. 
Pt's HGa1c was 10. ( He had not seen a physician in years ). 
He will be d/c'ed on glipizide 5. ( Metoformin was not started out of concern for rising creatinine. 
He may benefit from the addition of a second oral agent as an oupatient ). 
Pt. will be given a glucometer and asked to check his blood sugar mornings. 
HEME: *anemia* Pt. had a normocytic anemia , likely related to hematuria , gu+ stool. 
Iron studies revealed a Fe 49 , TIBC 294 , Ferr 73.
