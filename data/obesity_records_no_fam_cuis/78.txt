She was transfused to units of pRBC's in ED for HCT=24--&gt;28--&gt;31--&gt;28. 
The patient was initially started on a nexium iv drip and then was restarted on oral PPI once EGD was performed and no source of bleeding could be identified ( as above ). 
The patient also underwent colonoscopy which was normal. 
The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout her hospital course and her symptoms of lightheadedness , palpitations and shortness of breath fully resolved. 
No further episodes of melena occured during her hospitalization. 
The patient was instructed to avoid NSAIDs and to continue Protonix 40mg BID. 
The patient was instructed to have her HCT rechecked at her PCP's office the following week and to call the GI office for followup. 
Her iron studies ( fe 20 , TIBC 361 , Ferr 9 ) were consistent w/ iron deficiency and the pt was given an informational sheet on good nutritional sources of iron for repletion. 
CODE STATUS: FULL CONTACT: ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted for GI Bleeding and had an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate the source. 
Your upper endoscopy demonstrated mild erosions in the esophagus , but did not identify a definite source of bleeding. 
Your colonoscopy was normal. 
- As the use of NSAIDs ( including Naproxen , Ibuprofen , feldene ) increases the risk of GI Bleeding , you should no longer use these medications. 
Tylenol is a safe alternative for pain control for you. 
- You should have your hematocrit rechecked at your primary care physician's office on Tuesday , November to ensure that your blood levels are stable. 
- Your iron stores are low because of your recent bleeding. 
I have given you a handout listing good nutritional sources of iron. 
- Please seek medical attention if the bleeding recurs or you develop abdominal pain , lightheadedness , heart racing , shortness of breath or fever. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: - Please recheck patient's hematocrit on November to confirm stability. 
- Please recheck pt's iron studies to determine whether they recover appropriately with nutritional iron supplementation.
