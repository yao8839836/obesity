Since his last intervention in 10/24 for re-stenting of his LCx , pt had been pain free , able to walk about 1/2 mile without difficulty. 
On the morning of admission pt woke up with sharp chest pain associated with diaphoresis and tingling down his left arm. 
However , the pain was different from the pressure he had felt from his previous admissions that were positive for stenosis. 
Pain was described as sharp 9/10 that improved after taking his second dose of ntg. 
The diaphoresis and arm symptoms resolved concurrently with the chest pain. 
He received a third dose of ntg from the EMS and brought to ED. Of note , one week ago patient was struck in the center of his chest by teenagers "horsing around" next to him. 
The impact was severe enough to cause him to fall to the ground. 
He noticed pain around the region for the next several days that he described as more pressure like different from what he felt like this morning. 
Also noticed that since the incident he has felt more tired than usual. 
In ED patient was hemodyanmically stable HR 54-57 BP 113-142/64-78. 
Pt was afebrile breathing at 18/min O2 sat 100% 2L. 
He was given another dose of ntg by nasal spray , ASA 325 mg , Dilaudid 1mg for back pain , Plavix 75mg , and lovenox 100 mg.

The patient's PET-CT test results are normal and suggest no evidence of flow-limiting CAD. 2. Normal global LV systolic function. 
3. The results demonstrate interval improvement from his prior study of May , 2006. 
=================================================== CONSULTS: None =================================================== HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM 1 ) CHEST PAIN On arrival to the floor patient was pain free but began to experience nausea and vomiting which was relieved by ntg and then with a dose of compazine. 
It was unclear if the nausea was related to ischemia or the dose of dilaudid he received in the ED. However there were no ECG changes during his nausea. 
Altogether the nausea lasted for approximately 10 minutes. 
He remained pain free during the night with what he described as some slight pressure over his chest. 
His chest is tender at baseline ever since his CABG and it was difficult to assess whether the pain was MSK or cardiac in nature. 
He sometimes felt it was different from when he first presented with an MI , and at other times he describes the pain as being related to movement and to the kick to the chest that he received 2 weeks earlier ( see HPI ). 
Overnight on HD#1 patient did not require any more NTG doses , remained hemodynamically stable , and three sets of enzymes were negative for MI. Pt had several admissions in the past where he presented with chest pain and underwent catheterizations , some of which revealed restenosis and some of which were negative. 
Given his presentation was very atypical it was decided to do a stress PET the next day to assess ischemia and then re-evaluate plan. 
He was kept on his home regimen of cardiac medications in addition to lovenox 100 mg SC for ACS. 
On HD#2 when moving from his chair to the bed he began to complain of 2/10 chest pressure that he says felt a little different than the pain when palpating his chest. 
Again there were no ECG changes. 
He underwent a stress PET which was negative for ischemia. 
Given his presentation with a clearly negative study it was most likely that his symptoms were MSK in origin. 
2 ) DM2 Patient's home regimen of oral hypoglycemic agents were held and he was treated with basal insulin and a sliding scale. 
3 ) FEN NPO for stress PET , K/Mg scales 4 ) PPX Patient was on lovenox for ACS , PPI 5 ) Full Code ========================= ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: - Please take your home medications as you were doing. 
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you take your aspirin and plavix medications for your stents. 
- Please see your cardiologist Dr. Dorough as you had scheduled on January at 1:30pm.
