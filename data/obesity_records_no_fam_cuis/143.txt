Pt. felt somewhat nauseous on coming home from work on day PTA. 
Wife noticed pallor when he came home , called ambulance. 
Was found to be in monomorphic Vtach to 200 which responded to lidocaine. 
Lidocaine drip d/c'd in AM of transfer in the abscene of further VT. Pt found to have troponin of 0.8 at outside hospital. 
It was initially unclear if the pt had an ischemic event which caused VT , or if the pt's VT caused a bump in cardiac enzymes. 
Pt also has anginal equivalent w/jaw pain which worsens when the pt carries heavy things or walks up flights of stairs. 
Recent outside echocardiogram showed EF 15-20% , w/ global hypokinesis. 
PE onadmission w/JVP 10 cm , faint crackles , II/VI SEM worse w/inc. 
afterload. 
EKG , unchanged from 11/1 .  
HOSPITAL COURSE 1. Ischemia - The patient was admitted to the cardiac service. 
Given the presence of vtach and a slight EKG bump , and clinical signs of heart failure , the initial presentation was suspicious for CAD. 
The patient was initially diuresed slowly , however , the pt began to develop worsening HTN and shortness of breath along w/a prolonged episode of vtach and was subsequently diuresed aggressively by approximately 5 L. 
The patient was also loaded w/amiodarone. 
The patient's weight also dropped 5 kg. 
Left and right coronary catheterization were performed and revealed only a discrete rt PDA lesion 60% and a discrete 60% D1 , otherwise essentially clean. 
No interventions were necessary. 
The right heart catheterization revealed a PCWP of 6 after the diuresis. 
The patient had no further vtach episodes on amiodarone and was discharged on 400 mg qd of amiodarone. 
The patient had an ICD placed on 3/16/2004 .  
The initial plan was for the patient to also have his aflutter ablated to decrease the propensity for vtach , however , the presence of a lt atrial clot could not be ruled out during TEE , so rhythm ablation was deferred. 
An transthroracic echocardiogram was also performed prior to discharge which revealed EF of 30% , w/anterior akinesis and global hypokinesis. 
A broad differential diagnosis for his heart failure was entertained , however no conclusive etiology could be determined. 
The patient is to follow up with his cardiologist and his P CP. These appointments were coordinated by the attending physician , Dr. Pederzani . 
He should also follow up w/Dr. 
Schoeppner as described in that section. 
For the patient's afib , he should take coumadin , 5 mg , for the next three nights and should subsequently drop down to 2.5 mg qd , unless differently as suggested by his INR which should be drawn on Monday , May , and Wed September by the VNA. 
The patient should call an MD immediately w/chest pain , sob , or pallor. 
The patient's blood pressure medications were also significantly adjusted to maximum doses while the patient was under close acute care monitoring to facilitate optimization of his outpt regimens. 
Additional changes at the discretion of the pt's PCP , Dr. Lefevre . 
The patient also presented w/an elevated creatinine which slowly returned to normal levels during the hospitalization. 
The elevated creatinine was most likely due to a combination of hypoperfusion secondary to vtach , and dye load from catheterization. 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: F/u as described above. 
INR on June .  
Stop old medications. 
Take only medications as prescribed from here.
