OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. Poorly controlled hypertension. 
2. Diabetes. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Hirschhorn is a 62-year-old woman with cardiac risk factors of hypertension , diabetes , a positive family history , and coronary disease documented by a prior myocardial infarction who presented with increased leg swelling , a 21 lb weight gain over the last three months and who was seen in Clinic on February , 1996 , by Dr. Fiermonte , and was admitted for management. 
She had a myocardial infarction in 1981 and , in September 1995 , she had a three vessel CABG which included a LIMA graft to the LAD and two saphenous vein grafts to the OM and to the PDA. 
In April 1995 , her postoperative course had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusion which required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as a thorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication and drainage of effusions. 
At this time , she had also been dyspneic on exertion along with shortness of breath at rest. 
On April , 1995 , she had an echo which showed an EF of 59% , a mildly dilated left ventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branch block , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitral calcification above the normal right ventricular size and function. 
A Bovie study was also performed and was negative. 
She also presented with some biventricular failure and diuresis was attempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. 
Over the past two months , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gained approximately 21 lb since February , 1995. 
She has been quite active and not limited. 
However , the edema has been her most limiting factor. 
Three nights prior to admission , she had dyspnea on exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no chest pain and compression boots were attempted to try to alleviate some of the edema. 
She had no orthopnea. 
She claims to have no dietary indiscretions , no fevers , no sweats , no chills , no coughs , no chest pain , no abdominal pain , and no bright red blood per rectum , but she was more fatigued. 
On February , 1996 , she was seen in Clinic by Dr. Fiermonte and was seen to have increased leg edema and increased dyspnea on exertion with climbing stairs. 
An echo was performed and showed decreased left ventricular function within an EF of about 40% , decreased down from an EF of 59% documented in April 1995. 
Her CKs were flat an troponin I level later documented 0.4 , which was negative. 
Echo report also showed some inferior posterior hypokinesis , as well as significant tricuspid insufficiency at 3.2 meters per second , which suggested PA pressures of about 41 mmHg. 
The patient was subsequently admitted for management of her congestive heart failure. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction in 1981 , hypertension with systolics in the 200s , which has been difficult to control , diabetes for which she has been on insulin. 
She has a history of an amaurosis fugax in September 1995 and was started on Coumadin in January 1995. 
She has a history of the loculated pleural effusions and a history of TIA while being on Coumadin. 
She also has a history of kidney stones. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG times three in 1995 , right CEA in 1993 , and right mastoid surgery. 
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Ceclor which cause a rash. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin NPH 35 units q.a.m. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. p.r.n. , and Slow KCl. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a rather obese woman , totally edematous , who was slightly short of breath while talking. 
Her vitals were 97.3 , 64 , blood pressure 211/100 , respiration rate 20 , and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. 
Her neck examination was significant for a jugular venous pulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. 
Her carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there was a right CEA scar. 
Her chest examination was significant for few crackles at bilateral bases. 
Cardiac examination showed a normal S1 , S2 , but with a faint S3. Abdominal examination had a positive fluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upper quadrant. 
Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to knees bilaterally. 
DP pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses were unable to be palpated. 
Her weight , at the time of admission , was 233 lb. 
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values were unremarkable at the time of admission. 
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of 64 , left bundle branch block , and there was no change essentially since September 1995. 
Chest x-ray , on admission , showed increased interstitial markings bilaterally with perhaps a slight pleural effusion. 
There was also some left lower lobe scarring and there was an elevated left hemidiaphragm , which was consistent with increased initial pulmonary edema. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix for the first three hospital days , during which she lost approximately 17 lb. 
She was then switched to p.o. Lasix on hospital day four , and continued to diurese. 
She was placed on strict fluid and diet restrictions throughout her stay. 
Her blood pressure was controlled with a diuretic , as well as with a beta-1 blocker and ACE inhibitor and a small amount of nitrate. 
Her calcium blocker was discontinued while we were trying to diurese her. 
Her blood sugars ran low with her normal 35 units of NPH dose , so the dose was held for a couple days and she was controlled an CZI sliding scale and was resumed on 20 units of NPH. 
By hospital day five , the patient was stable on the staple regimen. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.6h. 
, nitroglycerin NTG 1/150 sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl slow release 32 mEq p.o. b.i.d. , ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times three days. 
COMPLICATIONS: The patient had irritation of her bladder from her Foley catheter and produced some bloody urine and then upon discontinuing the Foley catheter had some burning of her urine for which a urinalysis was performed. 
She was placed on ofloxacin for three days. 
DISPOSITION: The patient was stable upon discharge. 
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow up with Dr. Fiermonte on January , 1996 at 12:30 p.m. during a scheduled appointment. 
She is also to follow up with Nadia Wankum , her nurse at Norri Hospital to follow up on her blood sugar control. 
The patient will also have a VNA sent to see her three times a week for vital signs check , weight medical , pharmaceutical compliance , and her weights will be called in to Dr. Fournier She should also improve upon her physical therapy and increase her abilities for ambulation.
