HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Bartholomeu is a 71-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial flutter who started to develop shortness of breath , which worsened the night prior to admission. 
This is consistent with her previous sensation that she gets when her heart rate increases with atrial flutter. 
She also noted some jaw soreness , which she commonly feels with increased heart rate. 
At the time , she was seen in the hospital , she was asymptomatic. 
She also gets some pain under her breasts bilaterally when her heart rate increased. 
She denies any orthopnea and no leg swelling or PND. 
Her exercise is limited by claudication , which worsens in cold weather. 
Also when she gets up quickly , she continues to feel lightheaded but no loss of consciousness.

ALLERGIES: She has allergies to sulfa , which cause a rash , penicillin causes angioedema , tetracycline , and H2 blockers. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. 
She has a 40+ pack year of smoking , quit in 1986. 
No drinking currently but has in the past. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 96.1 , pulse 82 , blood pressure 130/60 , respiratory rate 24 and saturating 92% on 3 liters. 
General: She is in no acute distress , appears stated age. 
HEENT: She is anisocoria , left greater than right , reactive to light. 
Neck is supple. 
JVP is 6 cm. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Respiratory: She has crackles at the bases. 
Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds , soft , nontender , and nondistended. 
Extremities: Warm and dry , no edema , and 1+ distal pulses. 
She is alert and oriented x3. 
Her EKG shows V pacing with underlined flutter. 
Labs were notable for a creatinine of 0.8 , and a hematocrit of 29.2. 
CK and troponins were negative. 
Studies performed during her admission , chest x-ray showed atelectasis. 
An echo prior to admission showed mildly reduced EF , hypokinetic septum , LAE , dilated RA , and normal AR , 3+ MR , trace PR. 
A MIBI performed during this admission showed moderate aortic ischemia in the anterior wall and in the diagonal territory. 
Chest x-ray on 10/2/2006 , later on admission showed improved pulmonary edema , slightly increased size of small effusions , and no infiltrate. 
She had a TEE , which showed no clot and a mild-to-moderate decreased EF. 
She had a TTE with bubble study on 7/5/2006 , which showed no shunt , and an EF of 45%. 
She had PFTs , which showed a mixed restrictive and obstructive picture that was mild-to-moderate in severity. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: 1. Rhythm: Ms. Bartholomeu has a long history of atrial flutter , which has been poorly controlled despite extremely high doses of beta-blockers , diltiazem , and digoxin. 
She underwent a TEE and DC cardioversion and remained out of atrial flutter , and V paced at 60 beats per minute for remainder of her admission. 
2. Ischemia: She has a significant history of coronary artery disease. 
After her DC cardioversion , she continued to complain of shortness of breath and was found to be hypoxic on room air which we discussed below. 
She did have the positive MIBI as discussed above , but given her significant previous interventions , the thought was to continue to manage her medically since this would not likely be amenable to intervention. 
3. Pump: In 2002 , she had an EF of 45 to 55%. 
She was not on any signs of decompensated CHF , although her shortness of breath did improve marginally with some gentle diuresis. 
A repeat TTE on 7/5/2006 showed an EF of 45% , which was relatively unchanged from 2002. 
Respiratory: Status post her cardioversion , she was found to be saturating in the mid 80s on room air and desaturating further on ambulation. 
Pulmonary was consulted and a room air ABG was obtained that showed pH 7.48 , pCO2 33 , and pO2 52. 
She had no evidence of carbon monoxide , no methemoglobinemia. 
Her PFTs were as described above. 
With a gentle diuresis and with more ambulation , she improved. 
It is unclear why she had this transient hypoxemia. 
Pulmonary recommended a trial of Advair and Spiriva , if these made her feel better to continue these , if not then she could stop them. 
Also mentioned , she underwent a bubble study which showed no shunt. 
In sum , there was a question as to whether this may be related to atelectasis plus some underlying COPD plus her underlying small effusion. 
She was scheduled to follow up with pulmonary clinic after discharge. 
Peripheral vascular disease: She has been improved since three years ago and she had a peripheral PCI. 
She was stable on cilostazol. 
Heme: On Coumadin for her atrial flutter. 
Endo. 
We held her oral anticoagulants and her oral agents while she was inhouse and insulin sliding scale was restarted metformin on discharge. 
Ms. Bartholomeu was discharged to home with a plan to have her INR checked as usual with Dr. Seidner office and to have follow up PFTs at her followup appointment with the Rywalt Cine Rehab on 10/9/2006 at 3 p.m. at Boise Also she is to follow up with Dr. Spraglin who would arrange with her , after she home.
