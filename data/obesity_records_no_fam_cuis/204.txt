IN-STENT RESTENOSIS HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Rieley is a 53-year-old female with a cardiac history as follows. 
In October of 2001 she presented with substernal chest pain and had a positive exercise tolerance test. 
Cardiac catheterization at I Warho Hospital revealed a 40% LAD , 50% left circumflex , 80% RCA , and 90% RCA. 
Stents were placed to both the proximal and mid RCA lesions. 
In August of 2001 , the patient represented with substernal chest pain and had a positive exercise tolerance test. 
Cardiac catheterization revealed in-stent restenosis. 
She was treated with angioplasty and brachytherapy. 
In July of 2002 , she underwent repeat cardiac catheterization for recurrent angina and was again found to have in-stent restenosis. 
Again , she underwent a angioplasty to zero percent. 
Later in July of 2002 , she presented with chest pain; however , cardiac catheterization revealed no significant stenosis. 
Finally , in September of 2002 , the patient presented with her usual chest pain and a cardiac troponin I of 0.15. 
MIBI showed inferior ischemia and cardiac catheterization showed an RCA instent restenosis. 
She underwent PTCA without stenting. 
Today , the patient presents complaining that she has had a sharp chest pain across the precordium with onset three days prior to admission and was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
