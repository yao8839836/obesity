Discharge Date: 1/7/2007 ATTENDING: GOLEBIOWSKI , LOIDA MD SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Maness is a 78-year-old gentleman who presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion and New York Heart Association Class III heart failure. 
The patient also complained of fatigue over the last four years prior to admission. 
He currently denied any angina , diaphoresis , nausea , orthopnea , PND , presyncope or syncope. 
The patient had been treated with serial transthoracic echocardiograms which revealed an ejection fraction worsening from 60% down to 40% along with aortic stenosis. 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed no significant coronary artery disease and elevated left and right heart filling pressures. 
Cardiac catheterization was abandoned prematurely due to the increasing filling pressures. 
Echocardiogram was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 40% , aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 31 mmHg , a peak gradient of 50 mmHg , calculated valve area of 0.7 cm2 , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid insufficiency , mild left atrial enlargement , moderately hypertrophied left ventricle , global reduction in left ventricular function more in the apex of the left ventricle mildly enlarged right ventricle with preserved right ventricular function , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve with significant restriction and leaflet excursion , reduction left ventricular function compared to previous transthoracic echo one year prior to this present study. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for class III heart failure with marked limitation of physical activity , diabetes mellitus insulin-dependent , dyslipidemia , cardiac arrest , status post cardiac catheterization on 7/13/05 .  
The patient's course was complicated by marked bradycardia requiring insertion of a temporary pacemaker via a right internal jugular and then complete heart block requiring a St. Jude dual chamber pacemaker and generator. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for permanent pacemaker placement , status post cholecystectomy , history of skin cancer , and status post tonsillectomy. 
ALLERGIES: Patient has no known drug allergies. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 12.5 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , metformin 500 mg b.i.d. , and Humalog insulin 12 units q.i.d. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Per physical exam , 5 feet 10 inches tall , 138 kilograms , temperature 96 , heart rate 80 and regular , blood pressure right arm 110/65 , left arm 112/60 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate , and rhythm with 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. 
Peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally throughout. 
Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally. 
Neurologic: Alert and oriented with no focal deficits , otherwise noncontributory. 
ADMISSION LABS: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride of 106 , CO2 27 , BUN of 13 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 156 , and magnesium 1.9. 
WBC 5.91 , hematocrit 46 , hemoglobin 16.4 , platelets of 181 , 000 , PT of 12.9 , PT/INR of 1 , and PTT 28.1. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Maness was brought to the operating room on 7/9/07 where he underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a 25-mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve. 
Total bypass time was 101 minutes , total crossclamp time was 63 minutes. 
Intraoperatively , the patient was found to have a calcified trileaflet aortic valve. 
The patient came off bypass without incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit on 3 mcg of epinephrine and insulin and Precedex. 
The patient did well and was brought up in stable condition in normal sinus rhythm. 
Postoperatively , the patient was extubated and the Electrophysiology Service was consulted to evaluate his internal pacemaker which was reprogrammed and functioning well. 
The patient continued to require vigorous diuresis with a Lasix drip. 
He was extubated on postoperative day #1 without incident. 
The patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day 5. The patient experienced some postoperative tachycardia and his beta-blocker was increased with good result. 
He was also found to have a positive urinary tract infection and was started on ciprofloxacin for a total of five days. 
The patient at one point required 5 liters of nasal cannula to get his saturations in the 90s. 
He did continue to require intravenous Lasix but had weaned Lasix drip and had intermittent boluses of 40 mg IV to promote diuresis with good result. 
He was weaned off his oxygen and the patient began to ambulate and was cleared for discharge to home with visiting nurse on postoperative day #9. DISCHARGE LABS: Are as follows sodium 139 , potassium 4.0 , chloride of 102 , CO2 of 30 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 163 , magnesium 1.8 , WBC 9.52 , hematocrit 33.1 , hemoglobin 10.8 , platelets of 286 , 000 , PT 14.6 , PT/INR of 1.1. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Are as follows: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg q.6h. 
for remaining four doses , baby aspirin 81 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , for three days along with potassium chloride slow release 20 mEq b.i.d. for three days , Motrin 400 mg q.8h. 
p.r.n. pain , NovoLog 24 units subq q.a.c. , Lantus 60 units subcutaneous q.10 p.m. , Toprol-XL 300 mg daily , patient was also discharged on NovoLog sliding scale subcutaneous q.a.c. 
Mr. Maness will follow up with Dr. Loida Golebiowski in six weeks and his cardiologist Dr. Jackson E Part in one week. 
DISPOSITION: He is discharged to home in stable condition with visiting nurse.
