A thallium scan showed a fixed inferior defect and anterior redistribution on a later scan; this was on a preliminary reading. 
The final reading is pending at this time. 
After the study , he continued to have waxing and waning episodes of chest pressure that were not completely relieved with nitroglycerin. 
In the emergency room , he was treated with metoprolol , sublingual nitroglycerin , heparin drip and aspirin.
