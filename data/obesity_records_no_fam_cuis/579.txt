FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your chest pain was caused by decreased flow to your heart muscle which was corrected with a metal stent to keep the blood vessel in your heart open. 
It is VERY important that you NEVER miss a day of your new medication PLAVIX because this medication keeps that metal stent open. 
Call Dr. Katcsmorak or Dr. Hazinski if you have any chest pain , shortness of breath or any other worrisome symptoms.
