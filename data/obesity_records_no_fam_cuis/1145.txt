The patient had an ETT in September 1992 where he went 6 minutes and 34 seconds on a standard Bruce to a maximum heart rate of 145 and a maximum blood pressure of 170/90. 
The patient stopped secondary to fatigue and did not have any chest pain. 
The EKG showed 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in II , III and F and V4-V6 , and was read as suggestive of coronary artery disease. 
The patient was put on Atenolol 500 mg q.d. two weeks prior to admission. 
The patient was also diagnosed with hypertension at this time. 
One day prior to admission , the patient had three episodes of exertional substernal chest tightness associated with lightheadedness , diaphoresis , and shortness of breath.

The patient was treated in the Emergency Room with Aspirin , Nitro Paste and oxygen , and sent to the floor for further evaluation and treatment of his unstable angina. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes a history of a hiatal hernia , history of recurrent esophagitis , with endoscopy in January 1991 which was negative for Barrett's esophagus. 
The patient also had a history of lower GI bleeding in July of 1991 , and a colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. 
The patient had a history of urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy. 
He also has a history of urethral calculi and is status post an appendectomy. 
The patient has no known drug allergies. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Atenolol 50 p.o. q.d. and Zantac 150 b.i.d. 
The patient is a long time pipe smoker , and he denies alcohol use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , he was a 63 year old male in no acute distress with a temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 110/60 , pulse 64 , and respiratory rate of 18. 
His pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light. 
The extraocular movements were intact. 
His oropharynx was clear. 
He had no jugular venous distention. 
He had 2+ carotid pulses without bruits. 
His lungs were clear. 
His heart was a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
His abdomen was soft , nontender , with positive bowel sounds , and no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
His neurological exam was nonfocal. 
The rectal exam was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 107 , CO2 26 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 148. 
The admission CK was 70. 
He had normal liver function tests. 
His LDH was 144 , cholesterol 171 , triglycerides 257 , hematocrit 45.5 , platelets 198 , white blood count 7.42 with a normal differential. 
PT 12.4 , PTT 27.4. 
His chest x-ray showed clear lungs , and the EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 57 with an axis of -4 degrees. 
There were T-waves in aVF , T-wave inversion in lead III. 
There was no change from an EKG in October 1992. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for rule out myocardial infarction and treatment of his unstable angina. 
On the floor , the patient experienced chest pain and an EKG showed ST elevation in the inferior leads. 
As this indicated that the patient was having an acute inferior myocardial infarction , the patient was taken to an emergent catheterization as PTCA was contraindicated because of his history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeding. 
At catheterization , the patient was noted to have a 90% RCA lesion and a 90% LAD lesion. 
The RCA lesion was successfully dilated , and the patient was admitted to the CCU for post myocardial infarction care. 
His post MI course was complicated on 5/10/92 by 400 cc of coffeeground emesis. 
The patient's hematocrit fell from 40 to 35 , but was then stable. 
His Heparin and Aspirin were held , and the patient was given Omeprazole and antacids. 
The patient also had an episode of left arm pain without any significant EKG changes. 
As well , the patient experienced an episode of hypotension with the blood pressure falling to the 70's following a dose of Metoprolol 5 mg IV. 
The patient was treated with IV fluids and was then stable. 
On 2/15/92 , an echocardiogram was notable for left atrial size of 4.0 , inferior and posterior left ventricular moderate hypokinesis but good overall LV systolic function. 
There was 1+ TR , 1+ AI , and 1+ MR as well. 
On 2/15/92 , the patient was transferred to the floor where he was noted to have a low grade fever of 100.2. 
A subclavian catheter was removed and cultured , and several blood cultures were sent. 
The catheter tip culture grew coagulase negative Staph but his blood cultures were negative. 
This was felt to represent a contaminant and not requiring IV treatment. 
The patient thereafter showed no signs of infection and was afebrile. 
On the evening of 10/16/92 , the patient experienced two episodes of sharp left sternal chest pain , one lasting five minutes and the other three minutes , though unfortunately no EKG was done at the time. 
The following day , the patient was ambulating without chest pain. 
There were no further episodes of chest pain. 
The patient was begun on low dose Inderal 5 mg t.i.d. 
On the second , the patient had an ETT with a modified Bruce protocol which was stopped at 8 minutes secondary to fatigue and shortness of breath , and a maximum heart rate of 120 , and blood pressure of 140/70. 
There were 1 mm ST depressions in leads I , L , anda V2-V6 which persisted during recovery. 
The patient was presented with the option of remaining in the house with a repeat catheterization with probable angioplasty of his LAD lesion the following Monday ( 3/15/92 ) or recovering at home with readmissions in one to two weeks for a repeat catheterization with PTCA. 
The patient and his wife decided to opt for recovery at home , and the patient was discharged on 6/8/92. 
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated Aspirin one q.d. , Omeprazole 20 b.i.d. , Inderal 5 t.i.d. , sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Ativan 0.5 to 1 mg q6-8 hours p.r.n. 
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
