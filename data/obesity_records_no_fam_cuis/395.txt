Discharge Date: 9/27/2005 ATTENDING: COLASAMTE , ISABELLE EVON MD SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service. 
For the beginning of this dictation , I am going to defer to a pervious discharge summary dictation dictated by Dr. Debera Z Replenski . 
Confirmation number is 251249. 
It was dictated on 3/18/05 , therefore this dictation will continue over the hospital course starting on 10/28/05 , at which time , the patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit. 
We began weaning the milrinone drip as well as titrating up on her diltiazem and Neoral. 
The patient was seen by Speech and Swallow and her diet was liberalized to thin liquids. 
She was restarted on her diuresis. 
The patient began having positive blood cultures on 11/29/05 .  
One out of two bottles from 8/23/05 grew out Gram-positive cocci , but the patient remained afebrile and her white blood cell count was trending down. 
Further blood cultures were sent off. 
Central line was discontinued on 9/3/05 and tip was sent for culture. 
Further blood cultures were negative but the line tip grew out coag-negative Staph. 
Echocardiogram results revealed an ejection fraction of 55% , mild mitral regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pericardial effusion , without evidence of hemodynamic compromise. 
The patient underwent a cardiac biopsy on 3/8/05 , which showed focal healing ischemic injury. 
Despite all negative cultures , the patient continued on vancomycin , Bactrim , levofloxacin and Valcyte. 
Speech and Swallow then started regular solids and thin liquid. 
Her medications continued to be monitored by the Congestive Heart Failure Service. 
She did become slightly hypertensive and they increased her diltiazem. 
She continued on her antibiotics. 
There is a PICC line attempted to be placed on 5/26/05 , however , they were unable to withdraw. 
Therefore , they would return in the morning to attempt it again. 
Upper extremity and LENIs were done , which was negative for clot , except for in the left cephalic. 
Congestive heart failure people then suggested that maybe it would be best that the patient just stayed in the hospital without getting a PICC line to complete her course of antibiotics. 
She also was going to need a repeat right heart catheterization and biopsy. 
Her antibiotic course was finished on 6/12/05 .  
Only other issue was that the patient was seen by Ophthalmology and it was recommended that she will need reading glasses when she is at home. 
Diabetes management continued to follow the patient and congestive heart failure did as well. 
She underwent a right heart catheterization as well as biopsy on 11/16/05 , which demonstrated normal left and right filling pressures. 
They were 6 and 14. 
The patient was found suitable for discharge to home on 11/16/05 .  
At the time of discharge , Ms. Rosenblum looked great. 
Her temperature was 96 , heart rate was 96 sinus , blood pressure was 110/80. 
She was satting 99% on room air. 
Her weight was even from preop.
