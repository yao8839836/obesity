Pt reports one day of crampy abdominal pain with associated bilious vomiting. 
These symptoms are consistent with her previous angiodedema flares. 
Normally , patient manages her symptoms by increasing her danazol dose at home , but this time the increase was not enough to stabilize her symptoms. 
Thus , she came to the ED to get FFP , which helps with flares by repleting the missing complement factors. 
Pt's first attack was when she was 10. Pt has had multiple flares this past year including 6 admissions. 
She has had 3 tracheostomies in the past for flares threatening her respiratory system. 
Her GI complications include multiple scarring/strictures - is scheduled for a dilitation with GI next month. 
She has also had surgery in the past ( 1994 ) She thinks her trigger this admission is multiple stressors involving the health of many of her family members.
