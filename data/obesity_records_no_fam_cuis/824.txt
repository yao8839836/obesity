117585063 | PUO | 19549965 | | 099734 | 6/2/1999 12:00:00 AM | ATRIAL FIBRILLATION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 1/10/1999 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 6/6/1999 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Atrial flutter. 
PROBLEMS: Coronary artery disease. 
New atrial fibrillation.. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Berne is a 50 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) performed at I Warho Hospital two weeks prior to his admission. 
He presents with three days of palpitations. 
On 18 of June , Mr. Berne underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 100% occlusion of the proximal LAD and 70% occlusion of the circumflex. 
He subsequently had a two vessel CABG at I Warho Hospital with attachment of the LIMA to the LAD and the left radial artery to the circumflex. 
Postoperatively he went into atrial fibrillation which later converted to normal sinus rhythm , and he was discharged in stable condition on 24 of August on a medical regimen of aspirin 325 mg q day , diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. to prevent vasospasm of radial artery , Atenolol 25 b.i.d. 
Three days prior to this admission , the patient noted palpitations of his heart with fluttering of the neck associated with clamminess and diaphoresis. 
He felt no chest pain , no nausea , vomiting , or shortness of breath , but VNA noted that his 150 beats per minute. 
The patient presented to the Stusri Medical Center emergency room on 10 of June where EKG showed him to be in atrial fibrillation alternating with atrial flutter with a two-to-one block. 
An echocardiogram performed in the emergency room showed an ejection fraction of 54% with a mild pericardial effusion. 
By report from Stusri Medical Center , the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm. 
He was sent home on his previous medical regimen of Atenolol and aspirin with an increased dose of diltiazem to 60 t.i.d. 
The patient felt well on discharge with no chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , and no syncope. 
Laboratory studies in the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of emergency room showed low CK of 31 with troponin of 0.3 , magnesium 2.4. 
On the morning of admission , 17 of May , the patient noted palpitations again with a rapid heart rate to 140 to 150. 
He presented to the Gle Ra Csylv Valley Medical Center emergency room. 
As previously , the patient denied associated symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , back pain , PND , or orthopnea.

LABORATORY: On admission showed sodium 142 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , CO2 26 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 104. 
White blood cell count 6.68 , hematocrit 31.0 , platelets 299. 
18% lymphocytes , 71.8% neutrophils. 
PT 12.9 , INR 1.2 , PTT 24.4. 
CK on admission 28. 
CT 0.08. 
Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion but no evidence of congestive heart failure or infiltrate. 
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 130 beats per minute. 
Normal axis with Q waves in 3 , AVF , V1 through V4. Unchanged from previous EKG. 
Calcium 8.7 with an albumin of 3.4. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated with a medical regimen on admission of increased Atenolol to 50 b.i.d. , continued diltiazem at 30 mg t.i.d. , continued aspirin. 
Was loaded with heparin bolus of 5000 , and loaded with procainamide at a rate of 750 mg q 6 hours. 
Despite loading with procainamide for a total of 5.25 grams over 36 hours , the patient maintained rhythm of atrial flutter with two to one block throughout his hospital course with occasional variable conduction of three to one block alternating with two to one block , occasional breaks to atrial fibrillation. 
An echocardiogram was performed in hospital on 27 of February which showed an ejection fraction of 30% decreased from 45% on his last Gle Ra Csylv Valley Medical Center echocardiogram dated October , 1999. 
The echocardiogram from 27 of February also showed left ventricle normal in size with moderate concentric LVH , reduced LV function , left atrium enlargement , with no evidence of thrombus. 
Normal valves with a small pericardial effusion. 
Other causes for atrial fibrillation were considered. 
TSH came back normal at 3.1. 
New onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter was felt to be consistent with pericardial inflammation post surgery. 
The patient was maintained on procainamide throughout duration of stay. 
Dose was increased on 16 of November to procainamide SR 1000 mg q.i.d. 
However , this attempt at pharmacological cardioversion did not succeed in attaining normal sinus rhythm. 
The patient was presented with option of two to three weeks anticoagulation as an out patient with rate control on Atenolol and diltiazem to be followed by elective DC cardioversion at the end of three weeks. 
Also discussed was the option of performing a transesophageal echo followed by in house DC cardioversion. 
The patient and Dr. Meduna chose the first option. 
The patient was started on Coumadin and attained INR of 1.7 by the day of discharge , 8 of May Although patient had maintained atrial flutter rhythm throughout hospital stay , hemodynamically had been stable with pulse ranging between 76 to 110 with occasional tachycardia during activity and during the morning hours ranging from 120 to 130. Blood pressure ranged between 90 to 110 systolic pressure. 
There was a significant concern regarding the patient's decreased ejection fraction to 30% from preoperative 45% , felt to be possibly secondary to negative inotropic medications as well as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 
However , could not rule out possibility of new infarct or ischemia causing decreased LV function. 
In addition to his previous medications , the patient was discharged on Digoxin .25 mg q day and with instructions to follow up with Dr. Meduna regarding his dose of procainamide as well as the possibility of adding a low dose ace inhibitor. 
Patient will be followed by VNA Services and by Anticoagulation Service managed by Cora Chilo for INR monitoring and will return to I Warho Hospital in two to three weeks for elective DC cardioversion. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg q day. 
Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. 
Diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. 
Procainamide SR 1000 mg q.i.d. 
Coumadin 5 mg q hs. 
Pravachol 40 mg q hs. 
Digoxin 0.25 mg q day. 
Colace 100 mg q day. 
Captopril 12.5 mg q day to be filled only on specific instructions by Dr. Stroder FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Meduna on Monday , 8 of April , by phone regarding medication changes and will return to I Warho Hospital in two to three weeks for DC cardioversion. 
The patient and his wife will continue to monitor heart rate and blood pressure with home blood pressure cuff to follow vital signs and have been instructed to call Dr. Meduna if heart rate exceeds 140 beats per minute or if patient experiences symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , or increased palpitations , as well as sign of blood in stools or excessive bruising. 
The patient was discharged to home with VNA services in stable condition.
