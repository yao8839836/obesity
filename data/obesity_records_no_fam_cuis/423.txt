Discharge Date: 10/16/2004 ATTENDING: PERRY HAUB M.D. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 36-year-old man with a history of a familial cardiomyopathy , ejection fraction estimated at around 15% with marked left and right chamber enlargement , severe mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and PA pressures of 51 plus right atrium , as per an echo in 2003. 
He was also status post ICD placement in 2001. 
At baseline , he has a one staircase exercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. 
He also admits that he has been having increasing orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 
He denies , chest pain , palpitations , or peripheral edema. 
He also has a history of dietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading to heart failure exacerbations. 
Currently , he states that he has been eating "salty foods , " and has been drinking a lot of extra fluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always taking his medications. 
Consequently , he has noticed a worsening in his exercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably an increase in abdominal girth. 
Because of these symptoms consistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicians suggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management of his decompensated heart failure. 
Of note , he has been previously on a transplant list , but has been delisted given his noncompliance and continuation of tobacco use. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: In addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiency with the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aldactone 25 mg once a day , K-Dur 40 mEq once a day , lisinopril 2.5 mg once a day , Isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125 once a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. for volume overload. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: As mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes , occasional alcohol use , no IV drug use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the day of admission , he presented with the JVP in the 18 to 20 range on the physical examination with positive HJR. 
His cardiac exam had a positive S3 of laterally displaced PMI with the right ventricular heave. 
He also had a 2/6 systolic murmur. 
His abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites and palpable liver edge. 
His extremities were warm without edema. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: From the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diurese him IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. 
However , he did not respond well enough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip with Zaroxolyn p.r.n. 
We also stopped his Isordil and ACE inhibitor early on because of blood pressures in the 80s. 
On admission , his creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was 2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to start a low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. 
However , his urine output was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increased the Lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mg IV Lasix bolus. 
On this combination of the Lasix drip at 20 an hour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very good and effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day , negative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in with admission weight of around 90 kg. 
On each day , he diuresed about an half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point , he was less than 86 kg. 
We monitored strict I's and O's , checked daily weight. 
During the course of his diuresis , his sodium levels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking a lot of free water. 
The combination of free water intake in the setting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of his hyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventually to 122. 
We strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intake to less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodium levels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day of discharge. 
We monitored the b.i.d. lytes. 
Eventually , his blood pressures remained stable. 
His JVP decreased from 18 to 20 on admission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urine output , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the Lasix drip for one more day. 
We then discontinued the Lasix drip and transitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , which was his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. 
He continued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day of discharge , his I's and O's were finally about 500 cc negative , which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. 
His JVP was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. 
We re-added his Isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours and his blood pressures were stable in the 90s. 
Given his potassium , which was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decided to increase his Aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given his underlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standing K-Dur from 40 mEq a day to 20 mEq a day. 
An echo was done , which showed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ MR. 
They did not comment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. 
However , he is a candidate for Bi-V pacing given his mildly widened QRS complex stage III heart failure and having been on a very good heart failure regimen up until this point. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: At discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mg once a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and K-Dur 20 mEq. 
We also added folate 5 mg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level. 
He also takes Ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia. 
DISPOSITION: He is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with Dr. Lyn in her Thyroid Clinic on 3/1/05 .  
He has been again urged to stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because he is a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , he is not listed given the aforementioned reasons. 
Overall , Mr. Kinkle states that his symptoms have drastically improved. 
He no longer has orthopnea. 
He is able to exert himself much more without symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , and he is eager to go home eScription document: 1-4309936 EMSSten Tel Dictated By: WINZER , ELFRIEDA Attending: HAUB , PERRY Dictation ID 2684934 D: 6/19/04 T: 6/19/04
