The head was normocephalic and atraumatic. 
The extraocular muscles were intact; pupils equal , round and reactive to light; conjunctivae clear. 
The oropharynx was clear. 
The neck revealed full range of motion; no thyromegaly; no masses; unable to evaluate JVD secondary to a thick neck. 
There was no CVA or spinal tenderness. 
The chest was clear to auscultation and percussion; decreased breath sounds throughout; barrel chest. 
The cardiovascular exam revealed a nearly inaudible S1 and S2; no murmurs audible. 
The abdomen was soft and protuberant; nontender; normal bowel sounds. 
The extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , clear edema or calf tenderness or swelling. 
The neuro exam was nonfocal. 
The rectal exam revealed black and maroon guaiac positive stool. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Hematocrit 37.0; white blood cell count 17.2 with 75 polys , 1 band , 18 lymphs , 4 monos , 2 eos; platelets 439 , 000; sodium 136; potassium 4.4; chloride 104; CO2 23; BUN 60; creatinine 2.0; glucose 168; calcium 10.2; phosphate 3.8; protein 7.3; albumin 4.6; AST 37; ALT 23; LDH 271; alkaline phosphatase 87; cholesterol 210; triglyceride 226; CPK 72 on admission. 
The chest x-ray showed fat in the mediastinum , normal heart , no infiltrate or effusion. 
A KUB showed no obstruction or free air. 
A tagged red blood cell scan in the EW was negative for bleeding source. 
The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90; frequent PVCs; intervals 0.15 , 0.07 and 0.39; axis 40 degrees; flipped T wave in L; flat Ts in V6. HOSPITAL COURSE: #1 ) Angina. 
The patient was admitted with a story classic for angina. 
He was admitted for a rule out MI protocol. 
His EKG remained essentially unchanged. 
He was noted to be in bigeminy and had some frequent PVCs on several EKGs and on monitor , however , his EKG remained unchanged except for some labile T waves in the lateral lead which changed with lead placement. 
He was ruled out for an MI with CPKs which actually went up from a CK of 72 to a peak of 331 , but on electrophoresis there was no MB fraction found. 
The bump in the CK level was felt to be secondary to multiple attempts at a central line placement in the EW and skeletal muscle trauma. 
He was treated with sliding scale Nitropaste and nifedipine for blood pressure control in the hospital. 
An echocardiogram was done to assess left ventricular function which revealed no regional wall motion abnormality , some slight decrease in compliance but good LV function. 
An exercise tolerance test could not be completed secondary to his sciatica. 
On ETT he went for one minute and 44 seconds with a heart rate of 81-122 , blood pressure 136/80 to 144/80. 
There were no ST changes noted. 
There were some asymptomatic VPBs and no chest pain. 
He was discharged on Procardia XL 30 daily and given a prescription for nitroglycerin and instructed on how to use this. 
#2 ) GI bleed. 
He was admitted with melena and a falling hematocrit. 
A hematocrit drawn at CHH in January was 48 and on admission here was 37 and dropped to a low of 28. 
He received three units of packed red blood cells in the hospital. 
An endoscopy on 2/6/90 showed two small ulcers in the prepyloric antrum , one measuring 3 mm and the other 5-6 mm. 
Both were superficial and benign appearing at the time , and neither had stigmata of a recent bleed. 
Biopsies were taken with good hemostasis. 
No varices or esophagitis were noted. 
The GI bleed was presumed to be secondary to his ulcer disease. 
He was treated during the hospitalization with an H2 blocker which was to continued for 8-12 weeks after discharge. 
He was instructed to not take aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or to drink alcohol after discharge. 
The discharge hematocrit was approximately 35 and remained stable. 
#3 ) Leukocytosis. 
He was noted to have a leukocytosis without bands on admission. 
This resolved with hydration and was felt to be most likely secondary to stress reaction. 
#4 ) Sleep apnea. 
He was noted to be apneic at night by the nurses with sinus bradycardia and sinus pauses during the apneic episodes. 
He had one sinus pause at seven seconds. 
On the third night of admission , he was monitored on a sat monitor overnight which noted him to desaturate to the 60% and 70% range during his apneic episodes. 
He was presumed to have sleep apnea and will be worked up as an outpatient with a sleep study per Dr. Chuong #5 ) Renal. 
He had an increased BUN and creatinine on admission. 
This decreased with hydration. 
The discharge BUN was 23 and creatinine 1.1. 
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition. 
COMPLICATIONS: None. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Pepcid 40 mg p.o. daily; Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. daily; nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. chest pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. 
NEW ONSET ANGINA. 
2. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
