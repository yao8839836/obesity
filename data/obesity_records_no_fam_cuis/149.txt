Discharge Date: 12/10/2005 ATTENDING: GORGLIONE , JEANNETTE MD PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS DURING THIS ADMISSION: Decompensated heart failure. 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. Non-ST elevation MI. 2. Acute on chronic renal failure. 
3. Diabetes mellitus. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old female with ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic renal insufficiency who presented with volume overload. 
The patient has a longstanding cardiovascular history: Status post inferior MI in 1988 , CABG in 1999 with SVG to LAD , OM1 and PDA , with subsequent PCI of SG to PDA in 1/13 in the setting of a non-ST elevation MI that evolved into an ST elevation MI. 
The patient was readmitted on 10/29/05 with decompensated congestive heart failure. 
Since that time , the patient has required increasing Lasix doses with worsening dyspnea on exertion , shortness of breath , a 30-pound increase in weight , worsening three-pillow orthopnea , and increased lower extremity edema with weeping sores. 
The patient presented to Lostedin Nassjoh Valley Hospital ED on 3/5/05 with blood pressure 196/97 , JVP to 16 cm , bilateral crackles , and right greater than left pleural effusion on chest x-ray. 
BNP at the time of admission was 22 , 143 ( up from 19 , 189 on 7/13/05 ). 
The patient was transferred to the CCU for nitro drip and Lasix drip. 
She was diuresed with a net output 2 liters on 3/5/05 .  
The patient was then transferred to the floor on a Lasix drip at 20 mg/hour plus Diuril 500 mg IV as needed. 
Her nitroglycerin drip had been stopped on 1/14/05 in the morning. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease: Inferior MI in 1988 , CABG in 1999 , and ST elevation MI in 1/13 , ( see HPI for details ). 2. Hypertension. 
3. Diabetes greater than 20 years. 
4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 1.4 to 2.4 ) , likely secondary to hypertension and diabetes , but concerned for renal artery stenosis based on the history. 
6. CVA in 1991 - cerebellar. 
7. Status post a right CEA in 1981 , and left CEA , that is a carotid endarterectomy , in 1999. 
8. Peripheral vascular disease , status post aortofemoral bypass in 1999. 
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Toprol 200 mg daily , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , hydralazine 25 mg t.i.d. , Lipitor 80 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Lasix 160 mg b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , PhosLo t.i.d. , and Lantus. 
ALLERGIES: ARBs cause hives. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: A 135-pack-year tobacco history. 
No alcohol or illicits. 
The patient lives alone. 
IMAGING: Chest x-ray on 3/5/05 showed a moderate right pleural effusion , cephalization and pulmonary edema. 
EKG showed Q waves in 2 , 3 and aVF with T-wave inversions ( old findings , no acute changes ). 
Echo ( 9/19 ): EF 35% ( down from 55% in 5/24 ) , mild concentric LVH , diffuse global hypokinesis with new akinesis of the septal-inferior walls. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: a. Pump - persistent volume overload , minimal response to diuresis with 20 mg/hour Lasix drip. 
Attempted diuresis with Diuril , Lasix IV , and finally nesiritide. 
Nesiritide discontinued on 7/11/05 .  
Torsemide was started on 7/11/05 with improved diuresis. 
The patient has consistently refused dialysis. 
Blood pressure was controlled during this hospitalization with hydralazine , Isordil , and Lopressor. 
All medications were stopped on 6/12/05 .  
Ejection fraction 35%. 
b. Ischemia - enzymes peaked on 4/13/05 with a CK of 152 , an MB of 39.6 , and a troponin of 21.44. 
EKG at this time showed ST depressions in V4 through V6. 
The recommendation of the Cardiology team was that the patient undergo cardiac catheterization. 
The patient refused any intervention with cardiac catheterization due to concerns of further damage to her kidneys. 
A decision was made to medically manage the patient. 
She was briefly on heparin while this decision was concluded , and heparin was stopped on 7/6/05 with enzymes trending down , and no evidence of active ischemia. 
c. Rhythm - the patient had bursts of normal sinus ventricular tachycardia on telemetry. 
She was maintained on a low-dose beta-blocker until 7/11/05 .  
She has been in a normal sinus rhythm from 4/13/05 through 6/12/05 .  
2. Pulmonary: The patient has an oxygen requirement of 2 liters secondary to a right pleural effusion and congestive heart failure. 
The patient's IV diuretics were stopped on 6/12/05 in consideration of changing goals of care. 
If the patient becomes short of breath in the absence of diuretics , we would recommend morphine elixir 10 mg q.2 h. as needed for shortness of breath. 
3. Renal: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency was likely secondary to hypertension and diabetes. 
MRA on 4/13/05 to evaluate for renal artery stenosis showed right renal artery stenosis. 
The patient's creatinine increased to 4 on 7/11/05 , likely secondary to diuresis. 
Ultrasound was refused. 
The Renal consult team was following , but the patient refused any dialysis. 
4. Endo: The patient's diabetes was controlled with Lantus insulin and an aspart insulin sliding scale. 
There was concern for hypoglycemia on 6/12/05 in the setting with no oral intake. 
All of the patient's diabetic medications have been stopped at this time. 
5. Psychiatry: The Psychiatry consult team was consulted for major depressive disorder. 
There was concern for delirium. 
Celexa was started for depression. 
Seroquel was tried p.r.n. for insomnia and delirium , but it was stopped due to change in mental status. 
The patient was able to make her own medical decisions at the time of refusing cardiac catheterization. 
She understood the risk of refusing cardiac catheterization. 
We will continue no psychiatric medications at the time of discharge. 
May consider Haldol for concern regarding worsening delirium. 
6. 
The patient is currently DNR/DNI , comfort measures only. 
She is being transferred to inpatient hospice at Silvtonla Health .  
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: Include morphine elixir 10 mg p.o. q.2 h. as needed for shortness of breath. 
CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: Poor.
