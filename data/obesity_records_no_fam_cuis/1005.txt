SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. 
2. PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. 
3. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. 
4. SICK SINUS SYNDROME STATUS POST DDDR PACEMAKER. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Briefly , this is an 80 year-old woman with coronary history of hypertension , diabetes and atrial fibrillation admitted to Osri Medical Center on the 12 of September for congestive heart failure and was at the time , diagnosed with receptive aphasia and a right hemianopsia. 
CT of head was negative at that time and she was diagnosed with right MCA stroke. 
She was started on anticoagulation as well as Lasix and nitrites. 
Echocardiogram at the outside hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45%. 
She was transferred to the I Warho Hospital on the 3 of November for further evaluation here. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Sick sinus syndrome , complete heart block status post DDDR pacemaker. 
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
3. DVT in 1992 , 4. Right TKA , 5. Coronary artery disease , 6. CHF , 7. Depression. 
8. Diabetes. 
9. Hypertension. 
ALLERGIES: Include quinidine , procainamide and disopyramide. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Heparin , Lasix , Insulin , Cozaar , Imdur , aspirin , Humulin and sotalol. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Was notable for: She had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure of 108/54 , pulse of 78 , 95% on four liters. 
She is an obese , elderly woman in no apparent distress. 
HEAD AND NECK: Exam revealed oral mucosa was moist. 
Normocephalic , atraumatic. 
NECK: Notable for JVD of 11 to 12 cm. , no bruits. 
LUNGS: Crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally. 
She had regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , benign. 
She had 1+ edema bilaterally; 1+ pulses. 
NEURO: Notable for alert and oriented to time , place and person. 
Her language is notable for a receptive aphasia. 
Her cranial nerves II through XII were intact except for right hemianopsia. 
MOTOR: Gait was grossly normal. 
Grip strength was 5/5 and symmetric. 
SENSORY: Grossly normal. 
DTRs were 1+ and symmetric throughout. 
Toes were downgoing bilaterally. 
LABS ON ADMISSION: Were noted before of BUN , creatinine of 26/0.8 , K of 2.4. 
LFTs were within normal limits. 
Initial CK was 42. 
She had an LDL of 42 , HDL of 30. 
TSH was 1.89 , Troponin was 0.12. 
White count was 10.2 , hematocrit of 31 , platelets of 156. 
Her INR was 1.3 , PTT was 35.7 , urinalysis revealed 40 to 50 white cells , 1+ bacteria and 2+ leukocyte esterase. 
Her chest x-ray was normal. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ORGAN SYSTEM: 1. Neuro: The patient was likely to have a left MCA stroke at the outside hospital. 
Repeat CT at I Warho Hospital confirmed these findings. 
She was continued on anticoagulation since it was felt that most likely the etiology of stroke was cardioembolic given her cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. 
Of note , she remained stable until the evening of the 10 of June when she was found to have depressed mental status and new left hemiparesis. 
Repeated head CT was unchanged and she was felt to have a new right MCA stroke again due to cardioembolic causes. 
At this time , the family made a decision to make her DNR/DNI. 
She was continued on aspirin and started on full heparinization. 
Her neurologic status remained stable and she has improved slowly. 
Her swallowing improved and over the next several days ate normally. 
She continued to have a receptive aphasia although this improved and she was able to repeat although her naming remained poor. 
Physical therapy and speech were consulted and followed the patient. 
She continues to do well. 
Follow-up CTs have remained unchanged. 
She will undergo a SPECT examination to confirm this stroke but otherwise she has been transitioned to Coumadin for long-term anticoagulation. 
2. Cardiovascular: She is felt to have , given her new depressed ejection fraction and Troponin leak , she was felt to possibly have coronary disease and she was expected to go to coronary angiography given her progressive neurologic symptoms. 
This was deferred and she will be continued on conservative therapy including aspirin and anticoagulation. 
She was felt to be in some congestive heart failure and has been diuresed gently with some improvement in her oxygenation and cardiac exam. 
Her rhythm should remain at AV paced without any services. 
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be referred to rehabilitation center for further rehabilitation.
