Discharge Date: 7/16/2006 ATTENDING: KERTESZ , ALETA M.D. SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lemick is a 64-year-old gentleman with a previous history of myocardial infarction x4 who presented to the Emergency Department on 3/10/06 with shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion over the previous two months. 
The patient has known coronary artery disease and has undergone multiple PTCAs and balloon angioplasties in the past of his posterior descending branch of his right coronary artery in 1996 , and stenting of his posterior descending coronary artery in 2004 , also stenting of his distal right coronary artery in 2005. 
While in the emergency department , the patient had an episode of substernal chest pressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity. 
He received sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief. 
EKG at that time revealed a right bundle-branch block with T-wave inversions in the leads V2 , V3 , and slightly T-wave elevation in leads II , III and aVF. 
On 1/5/06 , he underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed the following , posterior descending coronary artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , right coronary artery with a distal 60% stenosis , left circumflex coronary artery with the proximal 60% stenosis , left anterior descending coronary artery with an ostial 50% stenosis. 
Right dominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensive stenting with 50-60% focal areas of restenosis. 
Distal right coronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80% stenosis. 
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmHg and peak gradient of 60 mmHg , calculated valve area is 1 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency , moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid insufficiency , and mild pulmonic insufficiency. 
Carotid ultrasound revealed right internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis , left internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis. 
Pulmonary function tests revealed FVC of 3.11 , 53% , and an FEV1 of 1.66 , 35% predicted. 
Chest CT also performed on 5/29/06 revealed cardiomegaly , massive calcifications involving the aortic valve and coronary arteries , pleural thickening bilaterally , nodular density measuring 7 mm in the lateral basal segment of the left lung most likely represents round atelectasis or focal pleural thickening , however , subpleural nodule cannot be excluded , recommending a repeat chest CT in six months after discharge , and small ascites punctate calcifications in the pancreas. 
PAST MEDICAL AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for myocardial infarction , class II angina with slight limitation of ordinary activity , class III heart failure with marked limitation of physical activity , status post a PTCA atherectomy and stent placement , hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , gout , anemia , positive PPD , status post INH treatment , herniated disk , history bladder cancer , status post chemotherapy treatment , polysubstance abuse including ethanol and tobacco , narcotics , and IV drug abuse. 
He is also status post a left thoracotomy for pleural effusion 30 years ago , a hemorrhoidectomy , and bilateral hand surgeries for contractures. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF ADMISSION: Atenolol 50 mg once a day , lisinopril 20 mg once a day , isosorbide 30 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg daily , atorvastatin 80 mg daily , gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d. , metformin 1 g b.i.d. , glimepiride 2 mg daily , oxycodone 10 mg q.6 h. as needed for pain , and Nexium 20 mg daily. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Cardiac exam: Regular rate and rhythm , with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. 
Peripheral vascular , 2+ pulses bilaterally in the carotid and radial pulses , 1+ bilaterally in the femoral and dorsalis pedis pulses , and nonpalpable bilaterally in the posterior tibialis pulses. 
Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally. 
Extremities: Mild varicosities. 
There is 1+ pedal edema in bilateral lower extremities , otherwise , noncontributory. 
ADMISSION LABORATORY VALUES: Sodium 138 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 97 , CO2 32 , BUN 26 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 66 , and magnesium 2. BNP is 2349. 
WBC 6.45 , hematocrit 31.6 , hemoglobin 9.9 , and platelets 192 , 000. 
PT/INR of 1.3 , PTT of 33.2. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Lemick was brought to the operating room on 8/13/06 where he underwent an elective aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a coronary artery bypass graft x2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery. 
Total bypass time was 164 minutes. 
Total crossclamp time was 127 minutes. 
Intraoperatively , the patient was found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was a bicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp , moderate adhesions in the left pleural space , requiring adhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery. 
Transesophageal echocardiogram post-repair revealed normal function of the aortic prosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation , with intermittent heart block following bypass predominantly with A pacing. 
The patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and in stable condition. 
Please refer to dictation number 6316454 for the immediate postoperative course. 
The patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on 7/26/06 .  
The patient's mental status waxed and waned with confusion , initially was with sitters in the Step-Down Unit , and also was in a rate-controlled atrial fibrillation , with a good blood pressure , and tolerated increasing beta-blocker. 
The patient's mental status improved , did well off sitters , and continue with rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. 
Mr. Lemick was placed on Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation. 
Neurologically , he remained intact , and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycin for H. flu and Staph pneumonia , which are both sensitive to Bactrim , and started on a 5-day course of Bactrim twice a day. 
He was cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day #9. DISCHARGE LABORATORY VALUES: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 99 , CO2 28 , BUN 18 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 95 , and magnesium 1.7. 
WBC 12.07 , hematocrit 27.9 , hemoglobin 8.6 , and platelets 396 , 000. 
PT of 19.3 , PT/INR of 1.6.

He will be followed by Pagham University Of Anticoagulation Service at 132-202-5576. 
FOLLOW UP: Mr. Lemick will follow up with Dr. Aleta Kertesz in six weeks , his cardiologist , Dr. Rodger Teems in one week in the Cardiology Clinic Niy Lastan Stonevir Medical Center .  
He will also have a follow-up chest CT to follow up on the 7 mm subpleural nodular density in the left lung base in approximately six months that will be set up by his primary care physician and cardiologist.
