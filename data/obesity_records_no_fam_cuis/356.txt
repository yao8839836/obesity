1-Epistaxis: may be secondary to anti-coagulation vs underlying blood dyscrasia vs allergic rhinitis vs recurrence of previous epistaxis ( possible AVM ) vs longstanding HTN vs tumor. 
Pt had another episode of nosebleed/clot while an inpatient , but no uncontrollable bleeding. 
There was no need to tamponade pt's nares , however , in light of her hx of menorrhagia , previous DVT/PE , and family hx of DVT's , it will be important to assess for different causes of hyper/hypocoagulability in this pt as an outpt ( platelet d/o , von willebrand's disorder , hemophilia , osler-weber-rendu d/o ). 
It will be also important to assess for possible nasal AVM or ?tumor( low likelihood ). 
Coumadin was continued as pt has high risk of forming DVT's. 
Her BP was also controlled with HCTZ/triamterene and captopril to help control bleeding. 
Pt's BP dropped significantly in response to Lopressor and HR's were down in the 40's , thus her Lopressor was held. 
Patient needed captopril for high BP , thus will D/C on lisinopril 2.5. 
She needs to be followed up for compliance and understanding of importance of BP control , as patient was not compliant on medications on presentation , had very high BP on presentation. 
2-chest pain: ACS vs PE vs GERD vs panic attacks. 
As pt has several cardiac risk factors , her CE's were cycled and she was ruled out for MI. 
An Echo was obtained to assess for systolic dysfunction , but EF was 65% , no effusions were found , and there was only mild MR. Pt does not have an official DM dx , however , given her obesity , she is at high risk for glucose intolerance , thus a HbA1C will need to be obtained as an outpatient. 
Pt also has a hx of hypercholesterolemia , and a fasting lipid profile was obtained. 
It will be important that she take her statins regularly. 
The pt had palpable cords and calf tenderness ( L&gt;R ) , so LENI's were obtained prior to d/c and these were negative for DVT , although it was a poor study due to her size. 
Pt also has a hx of GERD , thus the c/p may have been 2/2 esophageal spasm or GERD as it radiated to the back and right shoulder. 
Pt denies having had spicy foods or nausea/vomiting before the episodes , however. 
Pt had chest tenderness along the sternum and L ribcage , which may have contributed to her feeling of c/p. 
Finally , pt seems to have a hx of anxiety , per herself and her daughters and as she felt she was going to die and felt stressed during the nosebleeding , this could have caused her c/p. 
Patient had a adenosine MIBI prior to discharge and this was negative for any ischemic changes , and she was discharged to home to follow-up with her PCP for further medical management of cardiac risk factors. 
3-Fibromyalgia: pt was asymptomatic , but we continued her home regimen and pain control. 
4-FEN: IVF were avoided given high BP on admission and K and Mag were repleted as needed. 
She should continue a low choles/fat , and no salt added diet. 
FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your blood pressure was very high on admission but was easily controlled with blood pressure medication. 
This was probably due to not using your blood pressure medications regularly. 
It is crucial that you take your blood pressure medications regularly as prescribed as uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to heart disease , kidney disease , and eye disease. 
You must also watch your diet and eat low cholesterol , low fat foods and no added sodium , as this can worsen your blood pressure or even lead to heart failure. 
You must also continue your coumadin regularly as prescribed as you have a high risk of forming blood clots. 
Please come to the ED if you have continued uncontrolled nose bleeds , severe uncontrollable headaches , fainting spells , chest pain , or shortness of breath. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: 1. Follow-up HGBA1C , BP control , lipid panel , and chest pain with PCP as an outpatient. 
2. We recommend that the patient have a pharmacologic stress test as an outpatient to evaluate for possible areas of potential cardiac ischemia.
