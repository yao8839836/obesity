She has had several days of exertional chest pain characterized by substernal burning pain which , at times , radiates to the left shoulder. 
It is sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath without nausea and occasional diaphoresis. 
She was seen in the Emergency Department with chest pain on June , 1997 , with negative troponins and negative cardiac enzymes.

Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally. 
Nonfocal neurological examination. 
No motor or sensory deficits. 
LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray: Bilateral parenchymal opacities , most prominent in the right upper lung fields. 
Stable and consistent with previous examinations from May , 1997 , consistent with chronic sarcoidosis. 
Pacer wires were in good position. 
Electrocardiogram on admission , April , 1997 in the Emergency Room , normal sinus rhythm at 66. T-wave inversion in I , T-wave inversion in II and AVF , biphasic T-waves in V2 , and T-wave inversions in V3-V6. 
Slightly pronounced when compared with previous electrocardiogram. 
Sodium 143; potassium 5.1; chloride 108; bicarbonate 23; BUN 36; creatinine 1.8; glucose 255. 
White count 6700; hematocrit 30.9; platelets 143 , 000; MCV 85.1. 
Prothrombin time was 11.4. 
Partial thromboplastin time was 25.2. 
INR was 0.9.

Dilantin: Less than assay. 
Hematocrit on November , 1997 , was 29.3. 
Cholesterol total was 258; LDH 43; LDL 166. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Tollett was admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction protocol and underwent serial electrocardiograms and her enzymes were studied. 
She was started on Nitrol paste. 
Aspirin , linsinopril , and atenolol , were continued. 
Given her low hematocrit as a possible etiology for her ischemia , she was transfused with one unit of packed red cells. 
Stools were guaiac neg and anemia workup was initiated. 
She was continued on her albuterol inhale and nebulizers p.r.n. 
On February , 1997 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a 70% residual osteal diagonal stenosis , 0% left anterior descending stenosis. 
A stent was placed in the diagonal artery with 0% residual stenosis. 
Later than evening , the patient began to complain of severe left arm pain radiating to her left chest. 
Her electrocardiogram changes showed ST elevation in VI and VII , and T-wave more inverted in VIV. 
She received morphine and was already on a nitroglycerin drip , and she was taken back to the catheterization laboratory. 
Her spectral study on February , 1997 , revealed a 90% mid left anterior descending and 95% VI , and her left anterior descending was stented at this time. 
Following her two cardiac catheterizations , she experienced intermittent atypical chest which was transient in nature without sustaining any electrocardiogram changes. 
Her cardiac enzymes were significant for a CK of 409 with an MB fraction o 21. 
On October , 1997 , it was noted that her creatinine had risen to 3.1 , elevated from a level of 1.9 before the catheterization and a diagnosis of radial contrast induced nephrotoxicity was made. 
Her creatinine rose and rose to a peak level of 5.1 on May , 1997 , and then began to decrease. 
At the time of discharge , it was down to 2.2. 
The patient continued to have excellent urine output throughout the rise in her creatinine and was normal by the time of discharge. 
Her laboratories at the time of discharge were a sodium of 141; potassium 4.8; chloride 106; bicarbonate 20; BUN 31; creatinine 2.2; glucose 90. White count 6900; hematocrit 33.9; platelets were 203 , 000. 
She had an exercise tolerance test and ED study on June , 1997 , which showed an essentially negative exercise treadmill test and was a suboptimal study. 
She exercised for approximately five minutes on submaximal exercise treadmill test protocol with no evidence of ischemia , but low exercise tolerance. 
Her medications at the time of discharge included: Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d.; albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. as needed for shortness of breath; enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; atenolol 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.; nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual one tablet q. 5 minutes times three for chest pain; and Dilantin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
She is scheduled to followup with Dr. Sana Azua in her office in one week and will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient.
