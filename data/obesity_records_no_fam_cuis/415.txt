The patient was well until Friday before admission when he drove 2 1/2 hours to Hertall Louisgreen and he had some back stiffness. 
The following day the patient noted back pain , took some Tylenol but remained "stiff all day". 
On the following day , Sunday , he appeared better , able to tolerate walking well. 
On Monday he again had severe pain , came to the emergency department here at Pagham University Of where he had a CT of the spine and chest without evidence of abnormalities. 
He was discharged to home with Percocet. 
On the morning of admission the patient was again with pain. 
He was urged by his cardiologist to come to the emergency department to rule out epidural abscess , work up for cause of back pain. 
He was negative for any fever or chills.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg q day , digoxin 0.125 mg q day , Imdur 30 mg q day , Captopril 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol 50 mg q day , Lipitor 80 mg q day , Coumadin 3 mg po q day , Levoxine 75 mg q day , Lasix p.r.n. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife. 
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a white blood cell count of 11.17 , hematocrit of 44.6 , platelet count of 129 , with 27 lymphocytes , 55 neutrophils , D-dimer 278. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 67-year-old male with a history of mitral valve replacement complaining of severe back pain with Streptococcus endocarditis in 2002 admitted of thoracic back pain for four days. 
The pain progressed to the point where the patient had difficulty ambulating secondary to the pain. 
CT scan of the thoracic and lumbar spine on May , 2003 were negative for abscess. 
The patient had no fevers. 
His admission exam was benign with no aortic insufficiency and normal neurological exam. 
There was variable pain to palpation over the ribs with no pain to palpation over the spine. 
The patient was managed conservatively with Oxycodone , Motrin and Baclofen. 
He was initially admitted to GMS , and troponin was initially positive at 0.12 and then became negative. 
1. Infectious disease: Blood cultures drawn on March , 2003 grew 2/2 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs. 
Due to concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis or potential epidural abscess , the patient was transferred to cardiology. 
Infectious disease consult was obtained. 
Vancomycin and gentamicin were started on March , 2003. 
On October , 2003 a transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for vegetation. 
A MRI of the spine was negative for osteomyelitis , epidural abscess however the MRI did show severe degenerative joint disease possibly causing the patient's back pain. 
The patient has had numerous positive blood cultures for Streptococcus sanguous ( Viridans group ) , blood cultures were last positive on March , 2003 with a negative work up including a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and negative transesophageal echocardiogram , negative chest CT x 2 , negative abdominal CT ( which did show a small liver cyst ) , negative tagged white blood cell count scan and a negative back MRI. 
Dental consult saw no abscesses thus no evidence of a large septic source from the mouth although this particular bacteria raises suspicion for an oral source. 
Repeat films and dental evaluation on November , 2003 required the patient to get teeth cleaning as an outpatient. 
There is a question of some seeding from bleeding gums that occur about once weekly while the patient is brushing from poor dentition and gum care. 
The dentist recommended deep cleaning as an outpatient with prophylactic antibiotics. the patient was initially started on gentamicin , vancomycin , on October , 2003 switched to gentamicin and penicillin. 
He will complete a 2 week course of gentamicin and penicillin G on November , 2003. 
At that time on August , 2003 the patient should start a 4-week course of ceftriaxone 1 gram q day. 
PICC line was placed on August , 2003 to provide long term access for antibiotics. 
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol , Imdur , switched from Captopril to Lisinopril. 
Rhythm: The patient was on amniocentesis , digoxin , Coumadin for St. Jude valve and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
CT and MRI is negative. 
Pain significantly improved on January , 2003. 
The patient was on Neurontin and OxyContin and oxycodone and Motrin , may benefit from restarting on Baclofen if pain not well controlled on this regimen or persists outside the treatment of endocarditis. 
3. Endocrine: Continue on Synthroid. 
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: Insurance does not cover home antibiotics so the patient will be discharged to a skilled nursing facility for intravenous antibiotics likely to the Griffcoo Nonster Hospital on August , 2003. 
TO DO PLAN: 1. Follow the patient's INR closely while on Motrin and antibiotics , in the past when on antibiotics his INR has been difficult to control , goal range for the patient should be around 2.8 to 3.5 and his Coumadin was increased from 3-4 mg on August , 2003 given that his INR was trending downward to 2.0 on January , 2003. 
2. Complete a 14-day course of penicillin G , gentamicin on November , 2003 then complete additional four seeks of ceftriaxone starting on August , 2003 to be completed on July , 2003. 
3. The pain is likely secondary at least partially to degenerative joint disease with some contribution possibly from an infectious source but unlikely. 
Should titrate the pain medications down as tolerated. 
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Motrin 400-600 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. for back or musculoskeletal pain take with food , Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. q day , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q 4-6h p.r.n. pain hold if somnolent or respiratory rate less than 12 , Senna tablets two tablets p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q day , Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q day , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec 40 mg p.o. q day , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , gentamicin sulfate 110 mg IV q 12h x six days , penicillin G 3 million units IV q 4h x six days , Ceftriaxone not to be started until August , 2003 for 28 day course ending July , 2003 1000 mg intravenously q day , OxyContin 30 mg p.o. q 12h x seven days. 
FOLLOW UP: The patient should follow up with Dr. Shonna Saber , cardiologist at Pagham University Of who knows the patient well and who also will follow his INR levels once discharged from the rehabilitation center.
