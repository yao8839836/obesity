PMH notable for 1 ) CAD s/p RCA PTCA/stent 3/17 w/ repeat cath 9/27 patent w/o significant obstructive CAF; 2 ) DM on insulin; 3 ) HTN; 4 ) presumed diastolic dysfunction w/ 2/19 TTE showing LVEF=65-70% w/ mild cLVH; 5 ) RA , recently started on low-dose prednisone 5 qd; 6 ) h/o asthma per pt; 7 ) depression; 8 ) fibromyalgia; 9 ) gout; 10 ) gastritis/DU; 11 ) s/p ventral hernia repair. 
Now , pt described subacute chest/neck diffuse discomfort and episodic SOB possibly worse w/ exertion though not clearly related to activity , breathing , meals , position , nitro and w/o further associated sxs. 
Notes medication non-adherence at times due to depression and not re-filling meds; includes no lasix x3+ weeks. 
Seen by PCP w/ SaO2 noted to be 91% on RA ( on home O2 prior but not currently for e/o PNA ) -&gt; admitted. 
Overall , evaluated for dyspnea w/ neck/chest discomfort &amp; hyoxemia of unclear etiology. 
Performed ABG to confirm hypoxemia: on 3L NC 7.45/45/79 ( Aa gradient elevated at approximately 158 ). - Suspected DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION in context of ischemic heart dz/HTN w/ exacerbation due to med compliance including no recent lasix. 
This supported by a ) mild improvement w/ diuresis w/ lasix 40 IV qd w/ resting &amp; ambulatory SaO2s &gt; 93% on 2L and resting SaO2 &gt;90% ( though decreased to 87% w/ ambulation ) at time of discharge; b ) underlying CAD/HTN; c ) repeat TTE w/ low E/A suggestive of diastolic dyfxn; d ) crackles though no elevated JVD. 
However admission BNP=102 &amp; still some hypoxemia at DC &amp; unclear crackles despite diuresis suggesting additional process: - PFTs suggest RVD ( ? 
obesity/CHF v other ); A-mibi w/o e/o active ischemia; CXR/CT not suggestive of interstitial abnormality/thromboembolic dz/PNA; episode of panic w/ more dypnea possibly further explaining SOB though not hypoxemia. 
Outpt consideration of full PFTS , OSA screen , screen for shunt ( not pursued given correction w/ supplemental O2 ) - pt to follow w/ a ) pulm to see if possible ILD/other despite nl CT given RVD/hypoxia/RA &amp; consider full PFTs including lung volumes &amp; consider contribution of possible OSA/hypoventilation; b ) CHF clinic ( discharge weight = 186.4 
though no relaible weights established ); c ) PCP; d ) psychiatry to enhance mood and med adherence. 
Established w/ home O2 transiently at 2L given borderline hypoxemia w/ ambulation on RA and much improved sxs. 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please note that we have intended to make NO changes in your medications , in case you note any discrepanices , with the following exception: we increased lisiniopril to 5 mg once a day.
