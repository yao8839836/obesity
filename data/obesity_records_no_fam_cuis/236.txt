Discharge Date: 2/12/2002 CHIEF COMPLAINT: CHEST PAIN , SHORTNESS OF BREATH. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , HTN , IPF and some CAD who presents with the first episode of chest pain and shortness of breath. 
The patient first experienced a sudden onset of substernal chest pressure and severe shortness of breath five days prior to admission which resolved in one hour but continued to have some substernal chest pain and dyspnea on exertion with even mild exertion , i.e , crossing the room. 
This occurred over the next several days. 
The patient described the substernal chest pressure as being like hit in the chest and this lasted about fifteen minutes. 
The patient did have some nausea and vomiting associated with her symptoms and was most comfortable sitting up. 
The patient did continue to have increased shortness of breath at rest and worsened dyspnea on exertion with around two episodes per day of severe chest pressure/dyspnea/pain that required her to remain still over the next five days. 
She also noted diaphoresis with all those episodes. 
She denied any fever , chills , URI symptoms , cough , change in bowel movements. 
The patient did complain of some bilateral foot edema 1-2 weeks prior to admission. 
The patient has had stable two-pillow orthopnea and notes no weight gain or loss , but notes decreased exercise tolerance over the past month. 
The patient presented to her primary care physician today secondary to continued shortness of breath and was sent to the emergency department where electrocardiogram revealed some ST depressions anterolaterally with a troponin leak with a troponin level of 0.19 and was thus admitted to the cardiology Ville service.

Chest x-ray: Positive for mild pulmonary edema , retrocardial infiltrate and left effusion. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease , hypertension , diabetes , IPF who presented with five days of chest pain/SOB beginning with sudden onset five days prior to admission and had EKG changes consistent with a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction anterolaterally. 
Of note her troponin was 0.19. 
The differential diagnosis included unstable angina and PE with worsening IPF superimposed on heart disease. 
From a cardiovascular standpoint the patient has known coronary artery disease with EKG changes which is likely status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a question of continued unstable angina. 
The patient was initially put on aspirin , Lopressor 37.5 t.i.d. , heparin , oxygen and hooked up to a cardiac monitor and EKG q.d. and was ruled out for enzymes. 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed LAD ostial 90% , proximal 80% , diag ostial 90% , left circ 90% , 80% lesions , marginal 1 , TUB 90% , RCA 50%. 
The patient underwent PTCA and stent x 2 with good results. 
The patient remained chest pain free and had no chest pain on exertion , i.e. , with ambulation. 
The echo showed preserved left ventricular function with a good ejection fraction. 
The ejection fraction was found to be 55%. 
There was no discrete evidence of wall motion abnormality although the inferior and posterior segments were not well visualized. 
There was left ventricular hypertrophy. 
There was stromal mild right ventricular hypertrophy and overall right heart function appeared to be preserved. 
There was trivial to 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with right heart pressures within normal limits. 
There was thickened aortic leaflets with trivial central insufficiency and no evidence of any outflow tract obstruction. 
There was similar mild mitral regurgitation with the elliptic ring , the left atrial size was slightly increased and there was no evidence of any effusion. 
From a pulmonary standpoint the patient had LENIs which were negative for a deep venous thrombosis. 
PFCs revealed a restrictive physiology and poor diffusion consistent with IPF. 
The FEV1 was 69% predicted , TLC was 63% predicted , with a DLCO of 56% predicted. 
The patient did have a retrocardiac infiltrate on chest x-ray and the patient was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. for fourteen days. 
From a GI perspective the patient had a history of colonic polyps but tolerated the aspirin and was put on Nexium prophylaxis. 
The patient was hypokalemic on 3/19 with a curious whitening on EKG and peak T waves. 
The patient was treated with insulin , given calcium and treated with Kayexalate x 3 and the hypokalemia quickly resolved. 
The origin of the hypokalemia was unclear. 
The patient did have an elevated potassium with a low bicarb which was consistent with a type 4 RTA and also had hypoglycemia which was then treated with prednisone overnight for IV contrast dye allergy. 
The patient was also on Captopril which was discontinued secondary to her renal issues.
