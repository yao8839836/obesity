288431774 | PUO | 41739484 | | 8790519 | 3/28/2005 12:00:00 AM | PULMONARY EMBOLISM | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 8/8/2005 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 8/8/2005 ATTENDING: ISABELLE EVON COLASAMTE MD SERVICE: The patient was admitted on the cardiac surgical service under the care of Dr. Lottie Gudiel HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Harajly is a 69-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. 
He is status post CABG x1 and aortic valve replacement in February 2004. 
He presented to the emergency department prior to admission with shortness of breath. 
Chest x-ray was taken that revealed pulmonary edema. 
Stated he had been complaining of shortness of breath over the month prior to admission with no dyspnea on exertion or chest pain. 
While in the emergency department , he had respiratory distress with O2 oxygen saturations 69%. 
An echocardiogram was done at that time. 
It was significant for showing evidence of a dehiscence of the bioprosthetic aortic valve with prolapse into the left ventricular outflow tract. 
It was noted that there is at least moderate perivalvular aortic regurgitation. 
It also noted mitral valve had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 
As stated previously , he was admitted to the cardiac surgical service for repair/replacement of his aortic and mitral valves.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right arm AV fistula that was originally placed in the year 2000 and revised in 2001 , 2002 , and 2003. 
A right brachiocephalic stent was also placed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs , temperature 95.8 , heart rate 74 , blood pressure in the right arm 134/62. 
HEENT , dentition without evidence of infection , no carotid bruit. 
Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm. 
Peripheral pulses are the following , peripheral pulses are 2+the carotid , radial , and femoral. 
The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial are each present by Doppler bilaterally. 
Respiratory rales present bilaterally. 
Neuro , cool extremities with monophasic pulse. 
PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102. 
Carbon dioxide 29 , BUN 26 , creatinine 5.8 , glucose 195 , magnesium 1.9 , white blood cells 6.11 , hematocrit 28 , hemoglobin 9.5 , and platelets 98 , 000. 
PT 14.8 , INR 1.1 , PTT 42.2. 
Arterial blood gas showed pO2 of 64 , pH 7.38 , PCO2 of 52 and the base excess of 4. Cardiac catheterization data on 6/29/04 , coronary anatomy , 10% proximal LAD , 5% proximal circumflex , 85% mid RCA with a codominant circulation. 
ECG on 11/29/05 shows first-degree AV block with left anterior hemiblock with inverted Ts. Chest x-ray on 1/28/05 consistent with congestive heart failure. 
Brachiocephalic and right subclavian stents were in place. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BRIEF OPERATIVE NOTE: Date of surgery , 2/18/05. 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: See magna valve three months prior. 
EPL on echo showed grossly mobile on the stable aortic valve prosthesis moderate , MR. No vegetations. 
PROCEDURE: Reoperation of ascending aortic dissection , aortic valve replacement , #24 homograph , MVP with Alfieri suture. 
BYPASS TIME: 355 minutes , CROSSCLAMP TIME: 265 minutes. 
One ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal tube , two left pleural tubes and two right pleural tubes were placed. 
FINDINGS: Dense inflammatory edematous scar tissue throughout pericardium , especially periaortic. 
Right axillary cannulation with 6 mm Hemashield side. 
Percutaneous right CF decannulation. 
Uneventful re-sternotomy. 
Previous SVG PDA injured during dissection , repaired with interrupted 7-0 Prolene. 
Aortic valve prosthesis dehisced 3/4 of circumference with question of an abscess cavity near LCC/RCC junction. 
Debridement , the annulus is of extensive inflammatory tissue. 
Previous Dacron aortic root patch removed due to pocket of pus on the anterior aspect. 
No. 24 allograft placed with double layer proximal suture line. 
SVG and both coronary arteries implanted as buttons. 
Distal suture line continuous 4-0 Prolene. 
Transaortic and mitral valves replaced. 
After the operation , the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit in stable condition. 
His postoperative course was complicated by the following: 1. Infectious disease: Although , Mr. Harajly had multiple blood cultures , sent , they all proved to be negative as of the date of discharge. 
Although Mr. Harajly was never felt to be bacteremic , the cultures that were sent from the operating room were of the aortic valve prosthesis. 
This never showed the organisms identified on Gram stain and MSSA stain. 
However , the infectious disease physicians were consulted and felt that Mr. Harajly should be on vancomycin , rifampin , and gentamicin. 
As at the time of discharge , Mr. Harajly has finished his regimen of gentamicin and will continue to be on both vancomycin and rifampin until 11/12/04. 
The rifampin he will take orally and the vancomycin he will get after dialysis three times a week. 
While an inpatient , Mr. Harajly never had any evidence of leukocytosis or bacteremia. 
2. Cardiovascular: Ms. Harajly was noted to have a first-degree AV block on postoperative day #7 with a PR interval of 0.35. 
Up into this point he had been receiving labetalol. 
This was held and the electrophysiology consult was obtained. 
The electrophysiology service saw the patient agreed to be an excellent candidate for permanent pacemaker. 
Initially they attempted to gain access to the right brachiocephalic/subclavian. 
However , this proved to be difficult and ultimately obtain access through the left iliac. 
His permanent pacemaker was placed on 10/3/05 and was interrogated the following day and felt to be functioning appropriately. 
He was restarted on his labetalol and as of the time of discharge , has had no symptoms. 
Other than the above , Ms. Harajly was weaned from his oxygen requirement , mobilized rapidly following surgery. 
All epicardial pacing wires and chest tubes were removed without complication. 
He will be discharged home on the following medications aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , labetalol100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg p.o. 6 hours p.r.n. pain , rifampin 300 mg p.o. q.8h. 
, vancomycin for which he will receive following dialysis until 2/28/05 , Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , losartan 100 mg p.o. daily. 
Mr. Harajly will follow up with Dr. Colasamte , cardiac surgeon , in six weeks , and Dr. Journeay , cardiologist , in three to four weeks , Dr. Macisaac , the patient's primary care physician , in one to two weeks and Dr. Grinstead , cardiologist , in two weeks.
