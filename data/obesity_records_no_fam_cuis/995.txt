SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. SINUSITIS. 2. STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman status post cardiac transplant ( 11/27 ) who was transferred to the Pagham University Of with a history of hemoptysis. 
The patient underwent cardiac transplantation in 1991 for severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
The patient had a rather unremarkable course except for the development of some graft CAD ( seen on last catheterization ). 
The patient was admitted from 11/17/96 to 6/24/96 with a two month history of sputum production. 
The patient was empirically started on IV cefotaxime and his cyclosporine was adjusted up to 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
The patient's shortness of breath and respiratory problems subsequently resolved. 
A CT of the chest showed prior granulomatous involvement of the lung and spleen. 
The patient had AFB times three done: all negative. 
The patient did have Mycobacterium avium grow out in his sputum; however , this organism was not felt to be a pathogen for him. 
After the patient was discharged , the patient continued continued to have persistent ear fullness and pain , and a thick , but clear , nasal discharge. 
Then , approximately one week ago , the patient noted increasing cough. 
The patient denies any associated fevers or chills. 
On the day prior to admission , the patient noted his sputum was blood tinged. 
The patient subsequently coughed up approximately one quarter cup of bright red blood , which was apparently witnessed in the Emergency Room at the outside hospital. 
The patient apparently had some more hemoptysis ( amount not documented ) on the night of admission; however , the patient has not had any further hemoptysis since then ( approximately 20 hours ). 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Status post cardiac transplantation in 1991 ( secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy ). 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
3. Status post coronary artery bypass graft. 
4. Status post a left ventral hernia repair. 
5. Status post a right ankle fracture. 
6. Status post goring by bull in 1987. 
7. Liver laceration. 
8. Hypertension. 
9. Peripheral vascular disease. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Cyclosporine 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2. Cardizem CD 180 mg p.o. q.day. 
3. Imuran 175 mg p.o. q.h.s. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife in Re The patient was a janitor until 1/19 The patient smoked a half pack per day times 30 years. 
The patient drinks only socially ( occasionally ). 
Mother alive , but has diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On vitals , temperature was 97.9 , blood pressure 160/100 , heart rate 106 , respirations 20 , and O2 saturation 96% on two liters. 
The patient is an elderly gentleman lying in his bed in no acute distress. 
HEENT examination was normocephalic , atraumatic. 
Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. 
Extraocular muscles were intact. 
There was no lymphadenopathy. 
JVP was approximately 7 cm , with no carotid bruits. 
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , obese , nontender , and nondistended. 
Extremities had 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. 
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal. 
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 was notable for glucose 284 , creatinine 1.2. 
CBC revealed a white count of 4 , hematocrit 35.2 , and platelets 191 , 000. 
PT was 13 , PTT 28.2. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had no hemoptysis throughout his Pagham University Of hospitalization. 
The patient was scheduled for , and underwent , bronchoscopy on 4/3/96 , which revealed bronchiectasis of the anterior segment of the left lower lobe ( where the CT abnormalities were seen ). 
Purulent secretions were also encountered and sent for appropriate cultures and tests. 
No evidence of malignancy was seen. 
The Pulmonary team did recommend starting the patient on appropriate antimicrobial coverage for MAI. 
Therefore , the patient was started on clarithromycin and ethambutol. 
Given that these medications effect the liver cytochrome P450 system , the patient's cyclosporine dose required adjustment downward to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to keep his levels 200-300. 
The patient also underwent CT scan of his maxillofacial area on 9/12/96. 
This scan revealed air levels in both maxillary sinuses , as well as the sphenoid sinuses. 
Subtotal opacification was seen in most of the ethmoid air cells. 
Also , subtotal opacification of the mastoid air cells was demonstrated bilaterally. 
The frontal sinuses appeared minimally developed; of the few air cells present , there was complete opacification. 
The overall impression was pain and sinus disease with left otomastoiditis. 
The patient underwent further evaluation in the ENT Clinic on 7/24/96 ; their recommendations included Biaxin times four weeks ( the patient will be on this medication for at least four weeks for coverage of MAI ). 
The Infectious Disease team recommends that the patient's repeat AFBs be followed up and , if they are followed up , clarithromycin and ethambutol could be stopped after six weeks versus 18-24 months of therapy. 
The Pulmonary team also recommended that the patient be started on Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers and have a set of pulmonary function tests obtained as an outpatient. 
It is also recommended that the patient be started on a cholesterol lowering agent at his next Transplant Clinic visit ( LDL came back at 151 after patient's discharge ). 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. , cyclosporine 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ethambutol 1 , 500 mg p.o. q.day , Atrovent metered dose inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Imuran 175 mg p.o. q.h.s. , clarithromycin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Afrin two sprays n.a. b.i.d. times three days , and Ocean Spray two sprays n.a. q.day. 
CONDITION: Fair. 
DISPOSITION: To home , follow up appointment in the Transplant Clinic on 8/26/96 ; the patient also instructed to arrange a follow up appointment with Dr. Kooy ( Pulmonary ). 
The patient should have cyclosporine levels monitored carefully , especially over the next week or two.
