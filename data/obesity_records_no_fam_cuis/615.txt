Discharge Date: 5/27/2007 ATTENDING: MOOSE , BUCK M.D. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is rheumatoid arthritis flare. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , insulin-dependent diabetes , hypertension , sickle cell trait and chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ). 
For her rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , she had been long treated with methotrexate and allopurinol. 
In 5/3 , due to worsening renal insufficiency , her methotrexate was discontinued. 
Following this , she was seen by her rheumatologist with complaints of worsening joint pains and body aches , for which she was started on Plaquenil on 7/25/07 . 
On 10/3/07 , she presented to the Pagham University Of Emergency Department complaining of total body pain. 
In particular , she said that her left groin was very painful , although when asked , she said that every joint and muscle group was causing discomfort. 
She denied fevers , chills , loose stools , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting or other constitutional symptoms aside from a headache on the day of admission. 
Her pain especially in her hip was so severe at the time of admission that she felt that she was not able to walk.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Her temperature was 97.7 , pulse of 93 , respirations 16 , blood pressure 151/69 , satting 99% on room air. 
In general , she was awake , alert , oriented , conversant , but in pain. 
HEENT: Extraocular muscles were intact , mucous membranes are moist , neck was supple , JVP was not noticeably elevated. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. 
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
Abdomen: Soft , diffusely tender especially in the left and right lower quadrants , with a question of rebound in these distributions as well. 
Extremities: Warm and well perfused , no cyanosis/clubbing/edema. 
Extremities: Exquisite tenderness to palpation over the left hip ( due to severe pain , the patient could not be positioned in lateral decubitus position to accurately assess for bursal pain ) , positive left hip pain on internal and external rotation of the hip , and positive left elbow pain , along with pain in multiple other areas , without obvious erythema , effusion , warmth or trauma. 
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION: Her sodium was 130 , potassium of 4.1 , chloride of 99 , bicarb of 22 , BUN of 78 , creatinine of 2.3 ( baseline creatinine 1.9-2.5 ) , glucose of 227. 
Her white count was 11.8 , hematocrit of 26.9 ( baseline hematocrit of 29-30 ) , platelets of 378 , 000. 
Her ALT was 12 , AST was 12 , alkaline phosphatase of 98 , total bilirubin 0.2 , albumin was 3.1 and globulin was 4.2. 
Her ESR was 103 , CRP was 151. 
OTHER PERTINENT LABS DURING THE COURSE OF HER HOSPITALIZATION: Her initial urine sodium was 34 , urine creatinine 58.2 , urine BUN 555; urine eosinophils negative; urinalysis showed 2+ protein , 23 white cells , 1 red blood cell , 1+ bacteria and 2+ squamous cells. 
On 10/3/07 , urine cultures and blood cultures negative; 8/28/07 urine culture positive for MRSA , sensitive to Bactrim. 
On 3/8/07 , left hip washing and aspiration Gram-stain negative and culture negative. 
On 7/25/07 , C. difficile negative. 
HER RELEVANT STUDIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: On 10/3/07 , pelvic and hip x-rays demonstrated right hip rheumatoid arthritis , narrowing of the right SI joint; no acute abnormality or effusion in the left hip. 
On 10/3/07 , lower extremity noninvasive studies negative. 
On 10/3/07 , KUB showing gastric antral gas. 
On 10/3/07 abdominal CAT scan notable for bilateral peri renal straining ( old ) , mesenteric stranding ( old ) , left phlebolith. 
On 3/8/07 echocardiogram , EF of 60% , concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 38 plus right atrial pressure , trace effusion. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 65-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , diabetes , sickle cell trait and chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ) , admitted for diffuse body aches and pains , most likely attributable to a rheumatoid arthritis flare. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Body aches and joint pains: The differential diagnosis for the patient's body aches and joint pains initially included a rheumatoid arthritis flare , septic joint , crystal joint disease , intra-abdominal process or Plaquenil reaction. 
Her abdominal CAT scan showed stable peri-renal standing and mesenteric stranding. 
Her creatinine kinase was normal. 
Her urine culture from the second day of hospitalization was notable for MRSA. 
A left hip aspiration was attempted by Interventional Radiology; no fluid was obtainable , so a washing followed by drainage was performed , which had a negative Gram-stain and negative cultures. 
Similarly , blood cultures were negative , and an echocardiogram revealed no evidence of endocarditis as an explanation for her MRSA urinary tract infection. 
By process of elimination , therefore , the etiology of her body aches and joint pains was therefore thought to be rheumatoid arthritis flare , although of note , her ESR and CRP were a bit higher than would be expected for a rheumatoid arthritis flare. 
She was seen by the Rheumatology Consult Service , who stated that the Plaquenil would take a few weeks to exert its effect. 
As a result , she was started on prednisone and uptitrated per symptoms. 
In addition , she was started on leflunomide. 
Initially , there were plans to start Enbrel , and a PPD placed was negative; however , due to her concomitant MRSA urinary tract infection , such plans have been deferred to the outpatient setting. 
2. MRSA urinary tract infection: As discussed above , her urine culture day after admission was notable for MRSA , sensitive to Bactrim. 
Due to hip pain and one mild fever to the range of 100.6-100.9 with persistent leukocytosis in the range of 11 to 15 , Interventional Radiology did a hip wash and aspirate that was negative , as well as a transthoracic echo that was negative for evidence of endocarditis. 
Surveillance blood cultures similarly were negative. 
She was started on vancomycin , with plans to change to Bactrim upon discharge. 
3. Pain control: The patient was on standing and p.r.n. 
Dilaudid , along with OxyContin t.i.d. , the latter of which she refused due to nausea. 
She was , therefore , started on a fentanyl patch with standing and p.r.n. 
Dilaudid. 
She did well on this standing and p.r.n. 
Dilaudid. 
As of discharge , she has done well on this regimen. 
4. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the range of 170s at multiple times during her hospitalization. 
This is partly from pain , and partly from poor control of her central hypertension. 
She was maintained on Toprol , Imdur , hydralazine and amlodipine , which were titrated for a maximum effect. 
Because of refractory hypertension , we recommend that she undergo renal artery imaging as an outpatient. 
5. Diabetes: The patient was started on NPH , short-acting prandial insulin and a sliding scale , all of which were up titrated while she was inhouse. 
6. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient had acute on chronic renal insufficiency ( creatinine on admission 2.3 , baseline of 1.9 ). 
This was thought to be predominantly prerenal. 
Through her hospitalization , her creatinine gradually decreased to her baseline of 1.9. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: A separate dictation for medication list will be supplied when the patient is ready for discharge.
