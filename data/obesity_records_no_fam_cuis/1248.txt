ASSESSMENT: This is a 71-year-old woman with a history of hypertension , CHF , status post a mitral valve/tricuspid valve repair in mid September , complicated by postoperative C. diff colitis and UTI who presented with persistent diarrhea and three days of fever , chills and chest pain. 
The patient's fatigue was most likely related to dehydration secondary to persistent C. diff related diarrhea. 
Over the course of her hospitalization , it became clear that she experienced chest pain during her intermittent episodes of ventricular ectopy. 
Now that her NSVT is under better control , she is chest pain-free. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , statin and gemfibrozil. 
She had negative cardiac enzymes x3 and ruled out by biomarkers. 
Pump: The patient was initially dry on exam. 
She was rehydrated with normal saline. 
The patient developed shortness of breath on hospital day #4 , most likely secondary to overhydration. 
She was gently diuresed with IV Lasix. 
Electrolytes were repleted twice daily. 
She was then transitioned to 40 of Lasix p.o. daily and finally per cardiology recommendation 20. 
She will be discharged to home on 20 b.i.d. p.o. Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. 
On hospital day #2 , she developed atrial fibrillation with hypotension most likely secondary to Diltiazem , which was subsequently held. 
The patient's blood pressure improved dramatically with gentle IV hydration on hospital day #2. 
Her Diltiazem will be discontinued. 
The patient is on Coumadin now with therapeutic INR on discharge at 2.6. 
Per cardiology , her beta-blocker was increased to 75 q.i.d. and then she was transitioned to Toprol 300 daily; however , she had persistent nocturnal NSVT , which caused her some chest pain and was quite frightening to her. 
Per cardiology , she was loaded on amiodarone 400 t.i.d. , which will be continued for 5 days post-discharge and then the patient will be transitioned to 400 amiodarone daily. 
At the same time , her Toprol will be decreased to 100 mg daily , her discharge dose. 
Echocardiogram was ordered on the day of discharge per cardiology. 
See LMR for formal report. 
2. Infectious Disease: The patient with recent UTI and C. diff colitis in the setting of recent hospitalization antibiotic use presented with diarrhea and elevated white count and fever. 
Continued on Flagyl p.o. and vancomycin p.o. for Flagyl failure.

Stool became C. diff negative as of 9/2/06. 
Her diarrhea rapidly slowed on dual therapy. 
She will be discharged with seven more days of antibiotics to complete.

Continue Niferex at home dose , continue Coumadin at 2.5 mg nightly.
