HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old black female with a history of diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease , SVT and schizophrenia presented with 45 minutes of substernal burning , shortness of breath and diaphoresis. 
The patient has a long history of chest pain which began in 1988 with her first rule out for MI. 
She has had extensive cardiac workup including a recent ETT MIBI during which she went 5 minutes 40 seconds with a maximum heart rate of 71 , blood pressure of 138/68 with no ST segment changes and no evidence for ischemia. 
MIBI images: anteroapical defect on stress images with reperfusion at rest consistent with ischemia. 
These studies were done in October of 1992. 
The patient was thought to have rate related ischemia which is induced by SVTs or other precipitants that increase her heart rate. 
The patient has had no substernal chest pressures since October of 1992. 
She experiences no chest discomfort on exertion. 
She has had a good rate control on Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. 
The patient presented in the Emergency Room today complaining of epigastric burning in her chest 1 time a week which awakened her from sleep at night. 
It is usually relieved by Mylanta.

The patient's cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes , history of tobacco use and hypercholesterolemia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above: Adult onset diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a left great toe ingrown toe nail , diverticulosis , history of frequent nose bleed , multiple right pinna ear infection , schizophrenia , history of colonic polyps with guaiac positive stools in 1987 and a barium enema the same year demonstrating colonic diverticula , degenerative joint disease of the knees.

ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
Family history includes a brother who died at 60 of an MI , a sister who died at 71 of an MI. Social History: The patient is a widow with 4 children , lives with grandson , a retired factory seamstress who stopped smoking 25 years ago. 
She had smoked a 1/2 pack a day for 5 years and has no history of ethanol usage. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant black female in no apparent distress with a temperature of 98.2 , pulse of 100 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations at 16. HEENT: Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. 
Oropharynx was clear. 
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy. 
No carotid bruits. 
Lungs were clear to auscultation. 
Heart: Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds and normal S1 , S2. Abdomen: Abdomen was with normal bowel sounds , was soft , obese and non-tender with a hyperpigmented patch centrally. 
EXTREMITIES: Extremities are without edema or joint effusions. 
The left great toe had hypertrophic toe nails , tender to palpation with an ingrown toenail. 
Rectal was with guaiac positive stool. 
NEURO: Neuro exam was grossly non-focal. 
Skin had no new rashes. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admission data included a sodium of 144 , a potassium of 4 , chloride of 107 , bicarb of 27 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.1 , glucose of 155. 
CK was 430 with an MB fraction of 1.5 and as an aside , the patient is known to have chronically elevated CKs. 
White count was 8.7 , hematocrit of 36 with an MCV of 90 and 93 , 000 platelets. 
PT 13 , PTT 30. 
LFTs were within normal limits. 
EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 95 beats per minute with intervals of .18 , .81 , .35 and axis of 21 with Q waves in V1 , V2 , T wave flattening in V2. Chest x-ray was without infiltrates or effusions. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course by system: The patient was ruled out for MI , had CKs of 430 with an MB fraction of 1.544 with an MB fraction of 1.9 and 404 with an MB fraction of .8. There were no further EKG changes. 
The patient had no chest pain while in the hospital. 
The patient's Lopressor was increased to 75mg q.i.d. while in house and the patient also underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization with the following results: An LAD without critical stenosis , an OMB1 with a 90% proximal stenosis and OMB2 with diffuse disease and serial lesions , an RCA with a proximal 90% stenosis and a distal 70% stenosis , and normal ventricular function. 
The patient was offered PTCA of her critical lesions and the patient declined. 
As the patient had not been compliant with her medical regimen , it was felt that we would send her out on her increased dosage of Lopressor and monitor her level of chest discomfort and perhaps re-offer her PTCA at a later date. 
The patient's toe was evaluated by podiatry who felt that she had , in fact , an ingrown toenail which was treated via avulsion of the margin of the nail and a 4 day course of Cephradine 500mg p.o. q.i.d. 
The patient had all Ansaid held secondary to her guaiac positive stool and her hematocrit monitored and it suggested that the patient have a GI workup as an outpatient. 
The patient had anemia which was thought secondary to chronic GI bleed. 
Iron studies performed while in house detected an iron level of 31 , total iron binding capacity of 246 , a B12 of 904 , folate of 10.4 , and a ferritin of 235; all not consistent with iron deficiency anemia. 
The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia which was thought perhaps secondary to Pepcid or Ansaid. 
These medications were held while she was in house and her platelet level remained approximately 100 and was so upon discharge. 
DISPOSITION: The patient continued her normal medical regimen for schizophrenia and was discharged in stable condition on the following medicines: MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325mg a day , Librium 10mg b.i.d. , NPH insulin 42 units sub q q.a.m. , Lopressor 100mg p.o. t.i.d. , verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d , Prolixin Decanoate 12.5mg IM q o weekly and nitroglycerin 1/150 1 tablet sublingual q 5 minutes x 3 p.r.n. chest pain. 
The patient will have home health aid and VNA services to ensure more compliance with medication regimen and diet , also to check finger stick glucose every day , blood pressure every week and to administer her Prolixin every week. 
The patient is recommended to be on a 800 ADA diet and will have follow-up with Dr. in the KTDUOO Clinic.
