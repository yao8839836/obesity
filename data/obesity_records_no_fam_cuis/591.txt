Discharge Date: 4/2/1990 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old gentleman with a history of chest pain and atrial fibrillation. 
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , cigarette smoking and a family history; no diabetes or cholesterol. 
In 3/23 , he sustained an IMI complicated by V-tach , cardiogenic shock and Dresler's. 
He was discharged on digoxin and Lasix. 
He subsequently did well with chest pain only on extreme exertion characterized by retrosternal burning which radiated to his left arm with shortness of breath. 
It did not occur at rest. 
He saw Dr. Schwerd who prescribed Isordil with much decrement in symptoms. 
In 8/13 , he was found to be hypertensive with decrease in T-4. 
He was treated with captopril and Synthroid. 
In 6/8 , he had new onset of atrial fibrillation. 
He was treated with Quinaglute. 
In 7/4 , he noted dizziness with decreased vision episodically. 
He was treated with the discontinuation of captopril and digoxin was begun. 
Atrial fibrillation was again documented on a Holter. 
On 6/8/90 , he was admitted to Bussadd Southrys Community Hospital with atrial fibrillation. 
The quinidine level was 1.6 and digoxin level 0.8 , T-4 9.2. 
The heart rate was 64 , blood pressure 110/90. 
He ruled out for an MI. He was treated with an increase in his quinidine sulfate. 
His course was complicated by a five second pause. 
A DDD pacer was placed. 
He continued to have light-headedness without associated arrhythmias. 
An echo revealed an ejection fraction of 30% with inferior akinesis , left ventricular hypertrophy and a small pericardial effusion. 
While in the hospital , he had two episodes of chest pain which were abated by nitroglycerin. 
There were no brady or tachy arrhythmias noted at the times of the chest pain. 
He was off Isordil. 
The chest pain occurred with walking. 
There was no chest pain since restarting Isordil. 
On the monitor he was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm with a first degree heart block and occasional atrial fibrillation. 
The T-4 value was 9.2. 
PAST HISTORY: Cholecystectomy in 1983; hypertension; decreased T-4; meningitis as a child. 
ALLERGIES: None known. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate 65; blood pressure 120/90; temperature 97.5. 
The HEENT exam was unremarkable. 
Carotids 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits. 
The lungs were clear. 
The cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm; S1 and S2; no S3; II/VI systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating to the apex; no rubs; PMI nondisplaced; JVD 6 cm. 
The abdomen revealed a cholecystectomy scar. 
The extremities revealed strong pulses and no bruits. 
The neuro exam was nonfocal. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: White count 9.4; hematocrit 42; platelets 390; sodium 143; potassium 5.2; chloride 107; CO2 30; BUN 26; creatinine 1.8; glucose 90; PT 12.6; PTT 29.8; quinidine level 3; calcium 9.2. 
The EKG revealed dual chamber 100% paced; no atrial activity; rate 65; intervals 0.16 , 0.20 and 0.50. 
An EKG from 10/7 revealed sinus brady at 50; intervals 0.22 , 0.12; appropriate QTC; left atrial hypertrophy. 
Urinalysis was notable for a specific gravity of 1.025 , pH 5 , presence of urate crystals. 
The chest x-ray showed no CHF or infiltrate; cardiomegaly as well as a dual chamber pacer present. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Spoonhino Tonshoore Ln team. 
The Potwood Kinlis Wellscajohns Health Center team preferred to stop the Quinidex at this time and observe him for recurrence of atrial fibrillation with plans to start Norpace if this occurred. 
There was no recurrence of atrial fibrillation while in-house. 
The DDD remained in place with settings as per the admission note. 
He had a cardiac work up consisting of an echocardiogram revealing an ejection fraction of 30% with inferior and apical hypokinesis consistent with location of the old MI. He was maintained on Isordil and atenolol as part of his admission regimen without symptoms while in-house. 
On the prior to discharge , he underwent a standard Bruce ETT. 
He exercised nine minutes stopping secondary to fatigue with a peak heart rate of 105; blood pressure increased from 100/80 to 124/78. 
There were no ST-T wave changes from baseline. 
He was thought to be maximally medicated. 
His pulse pressure product at rest was excellent and well maintained , and he was asymptomatic. 
He was maintained on his current cardiac regimen. 
He was noted to have a mildly elevated BUN at 26 and creatinine 1.8 on admission. 
He was found to have urate crystals in his urine. 
His BUN decreased to 23 and creatinine 1.3 prior to discharge. 
We will consider alkalyzing his urine if we suspect a true urate nephropathy. 
DISPOSITION: He was discharged to home on 1/19/90 . 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. 
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. 
3. ASYSTOLE. 
4. QUESTION OF URIC ACID NEPHROPATHY.
