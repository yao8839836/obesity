4. Dilaudid causing mental status change , added on this admission. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: 1. Tobacco , 80-pack-year history , quit in 1990. 
2. No alcohol. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for temperature of 99.2 , heart rate of 121 in sinus tachycardia , blood pressure 116/60 , saturating 98% on room air. 
She was noted to have a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. 
Lungs were clear bilaterally. 
Pulse exam showed no palpable femoral pulses and biphasic dopplerable pulses bilaterally , DP and PT. Extremities showed bilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration at the base of the left fourth toe. 
All toes are exquisitely tender to palpation. 
Sensation is decreased but equal bilaterally. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This 75-year-old female vasculopath was admitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vascular disease which was suspected to be contributing to her new ulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as an exacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , status post coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. 
She was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and plan was made for an MRA to evaluate her anatomy. 
Unfortunately , the patient was unable to tolerate the MR and did experience some mental status changes that prevented further noninvasive imaging , when she received some narcotic following her hemodialysis round. 
Over the ensuing days she required rather significant doses of Zyprexa and Haldol to contain agitation and delirium , as the patient would also get physical and violent. 
This appeared to sedate her sufficiently and over the following days , she did manage to calm significantly and returned to her baseline mental status. 
She did appear very emotionally labile throughout the rest of her stay and incredibly remorseful for previous events. 
On 6/28/2006 , she was offered an angiogram to delineate aortic and bilateral lower extremity runoff anatomy. 
She did tolerate this well under simple IV conscious sedation. 
This showed chronic disease with collateralization and very poor inflow to the bilateral feet with essentially one vessel run off on either side. 
After extensive discussions with the patient and the patient's family , the patient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass graft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication. 
Please see the operative note for further details. 
The patient did tolerate the procedure well. 
By time of discharge , she was tolerating a regular diet and ambulating at baseline with her rolling walker. 
The pain was well controlled with minimal analgesics that were not narcotic based. 
Cardiology was consulted during this time to optimize her prior to the OR. 
Her primary cardiologist , Dr. Katcsmorak did make some recommendations including an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormalities. 
Her beta blockade was titrated up and she was instructed to follow up with cardiology. 
She did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without undue difficulty. 
She did on one occasion experience dyspnea following hemodialysis that resolved of its own accord , no cardiac events or in evidence by EKG or by following cardiac enzymes. 
As the patient was in stable condition and back to her baseline level of activity with very strong support at home , she was discharged to home with services for wound checks and home safety evaluation. 
She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Loerwald in one to two weeks. 
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Touchdown weightbearing on the left heel. 
The patient should not keep legs in dependent position for more than 10 minutes at a time. 
She was to use the walker and a cane as instructed by physical therapy. 
2. Legs are to be elevated as much as possible while sitting or lying down.

5. Showering only , no bathing or immersion in water for prolonged periods of time. 
6. Follow-up visit to be scheduled with Dr. Loerwald in one to two weeks and Dr. Hazinski primary care physician in one week.
