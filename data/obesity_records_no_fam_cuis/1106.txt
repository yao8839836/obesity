HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Brash is a 75-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% status post ICD and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis who was admitted on July , 2005 after his ICD fired at home for ventricular fibrillation. 
He notes a productive cough , a subjective fever and nausea and vomiting at home. 
He was subsequently seen in Electrophysiology Clinic. 
He had a low grade fever of 100.0 at that time. 
He was electively admitted but on the way to the floor , his ICD fired again. 
He was given lidocaine and after a third firing of his ICD , he was begun on amiodarone. 
The patient then became short of breath and was in pulmonary edema , requiring intubation. 
Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe white out. 
The patient was taken to Cath for possible ischemia contributing to his ventricular fibrillation. 
He had a proximal 80% LAD lesion and a mid 70% LAD lesion which were both stented with Seifer stents. 
He also had a 60% D1 lesion which was angioplastied to a residual 40% lesion. 
He also had a 70% left circumflex lesion. 
After catheterization , the patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. 
He was continued on his amiodarone load. 
He had no further arrhythmias during his ICU stay. 
He was extubated the following day and was diuresed for congestive heart failure. 
He also began treatment for both community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. 
He was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on May , 2005. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , EF of 15% , status post ICD and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , and hypothyroidism. 
HOME MEDICATIONS: 1. Synthroid. 2. Lasix. 
3. Coumadin. 
4. Lopressor. 5. Lorazepam. 
6. Colace. 
7. Prilosec. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 81 , blood pressure 108/74 , oxygen saturation of 84% on room air , and 97% on four liters. 
JVP of 14 cm. 
Lungs with bibasilar rales. 
Cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm. 
His abdomen was soft with a pulsatile liver and mild right lower quadrant tenderness with no rebound or guarding. 
His extremities had trace pitting edema. 
Examination of his skin revealed vesicles at the sternum above the nipple line with a papular rash extending in a dermatomal pattern around to the right side of the back to the midline as well as extension down the inner portion of his upper arm. 
LABS: Labs were significant for a creatinine of 2.1 , and a negative troponin on the day of admission. 
IMPRESSION: 75-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted with ventricular fibrillation of unclear etiology , though possibilities include underlying infection or cardiac ischemia. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient was taken to the Cath Lab and had stents placed in the LAD with other residual disease remaining. 
The patient was continued on a regimen of aspirin , Plavix and a statin. 
The patient often refused to take the statin , though this was recommended. 
He was also started on a low dose of ace inhibitor which the patient frequently refused as well. 
We would recommend starting a beta-blocker when the patient is more stable. 
The patient continued to be diuresed with Lasix until he was uvolemic and then resumed his home dose of Lasix 80 mg daily. 
An echo during admission showed an EF of 15% with moderate aortic stenosis. 
For his episodes of ventricular fibrillation , the patient was begun on an amiodarone load with a goal of a total of 10 grams at which point he should be tapered to 40 mg per day. 
He has one day remaining of his amiodarone load and should begin the 400 mg per day dose on September , 2005. 
He was monitored on telemetry without significant event. 
The patient should follow up with Dr. Grap in Electrophysiology Clinic. 
2. Infectious Disease: The patient was treated for both community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia with cefotaxime , azithromycin and Flagyl. 
The patient completed a 5-day course of azithromycin. 
He is still in the process of completing a total 10 day course of cephalosporin and Flagyl. 
He has one more day of therapy remaining. 
The patient was also noted to have shingles. 
The patient reports experiencing pain that started on his back before the rash appeared. 
The rash was present prior to admission. 
He was started on acyclovir on May , 2005 and this was stopped on November , 2005 given that there was likely little utility of treatment begun greater than 48 hours into the course and because the patient preferred not to take the medication. 
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5. 
Creatinine was initially elevated to 2.1 , but improved back to baseline prior to discharge. 
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , but was on no medications as an outpatient. 
He received a diabetic diet and was treated with a regular insulin sliding scale during admission. 
Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 , indicating poor glycemic control. 
He was started on a low dose of glipizide and the regular insulin sliding scale was discontinued. 
The patient also has a history of hypothyroidism. 
TSH was checked and was 1.6 , which is within normal limits. 
The patient was also noted to have a low calcium level and was found to be vitamin D deficient. 
We have started supplementation of vitamin D. 5. Heme: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation and low ejection fraction. 
The patient's Coumadin was initially held but then restarted on October , 2005. 
He is now therapeutic. 
Goal INR is 2-3. 
He will need to be monitored and Coumadin adjusted as needed. 
The patient also has iron deficiency anemia. 
He will need GI evaluation in the future. 
He was begun on iron supplementation , however , the patient frequently refuses to take this medication. 
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is therapeutic on Coumadin. 
7. Code status: The patient is full code. 
FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Blood draw in 2-3 days to monitor INR and creatinine. 
Please adjust Coumadin dose for a goal INR of 2-3. 
2. Taper amiodarone to 40 mg daily on September , 2005 from the loading dose of 400 mg t.i.d. 3. Please encourage the patient to take simvastatin , captopril and iron supplements. 
The patient frequently refuses to take these recommended medications.
