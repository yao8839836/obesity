She experienced similar SOB on prior episodes. 
She has had no CP. 
Her SOB is primarily related to her body habitus. 
IN PUO ED , hypoxic to 80s on RA , up to 90s on 3L NC. Had clear CXR , Patient's prior PE protocol was negitive though she did have a positive D-Dimer. 
In ED EKG was w/ inf lat ST segment depressoions that were unchanged from prior. 
She also has LA enlargement. 
While in ED patient's troponin returned 1.64 ( prior less than assay a couple of days PTA ). 
PE: 98.4 80 163/81 98% on 3L L homonomous hemianopsia , Chest clear. 
JVP 12-15. 
3/6 SM at LUSB. 2+ non-pitting LLE edema , 1+ RLE edema CK130 MB9.0 Tn1.64 ************************************************ Impression: 59 yo F with DM , OSA , HTN , s/p CVA with hypoxia likely 2/2 OSA here w/ likely demand related ischemia 2/2 hypoxia.* 
Pulm HTN is also a possibility as a cause for her desaturation and SOB , but past echo was unable to get PA pressure due to body habitus. 
Mainstay of treatment now seems to be good respiratory rehab , use of CPAP in PM and ultimately weight reduction. 
CV: I- ruled out ACS w/ serial enzymes. 
Gave ASA , Lipitor 80 , heparin , ACE-I , low dose beta-blocker ( low dose as has COPD/reactive airway ). 
PULM: Hypoxia at baseline. 
Recent PE-CT neg. 
Last admission her D-Dimer was elevated but it was also elevated 5 years ago. 
Overall PE was not leading diagnosis. 
On albuterol and nasacort. 
ABG with acidosis and co2 retention in addition to sig Aa gradient , bipap and O2. No facial BIPAP in house. 
ENDO: DM. On NPH and humolog.
