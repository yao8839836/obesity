HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old male who was being worked up for other surgery and during preoperative testing he was noted to have an abnormal EKG. 
This prompted a cardiac stress test , which was abnormal. 
He therefore received additional cardiac workup and was found to have coronary artery disease. 
He does have a history of atrial fibrillation in the past , but reports that he has not had any symptoms prior to his initially planned shoulder surgery. 
He therefore presented for CABG rather than having shoulder surgery. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Diabetes. 
3. Hyperlipidemia. 
4. COPD. 5. BPH. 6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
7. Nephrolithiasis. 
8. Impotence. 
9. Bursitis. 
10. Non-allergic rhinitis. 
11. 
History of hepatitis in 1960. 
12. Constipation. 
13. Right-sided renal artery stenosis. 
14. 
Renal insufficiency. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Left rotator cuff repair in 1991. 
2. Tonsillectomy. 3. Thumb surgery in childhood. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking. 
He also drinks approximately 2 beers per month. 
ALLERGIES: Procainamide , which causes diarrhea and arthralgia , also verapamil , which can cause constipation. 
MEDICATIONS UPON ADMISSION: 1. Toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Propafenone 150 mg p.o. q.d. 4. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 5. Rhinocort Aqua 32 mcg q.d. 6. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. 7. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d. 8. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , height 5 feet 10 inches , weight 102 kg , heart rate of 54 , blood pressure 130/88 in the right arm and 142/88 in the left arm. 
HEENT: Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light. 
Extraocular movements are intact. 
Mucous membranes are moist. 
Oropharynx is clear. 
There are no carotid bruits. 
Dentition is without evidence of infection. 
Chest is free of incisions. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. 
There are no murmurs. 
Pulses: Carotid , radial , femoral , dorsalis pedis , and posterior tibialis pulses are all 2+ bilaterally. 
Allen's test in the left upper extremity was normal with using a pulse oximeter. 
Respiratory: The patient has clear breath sounds bilaterally. 
Abdomen: There are no incisions. 
Abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds. 
Extremities: Are free of scarring , varicosities or edema. 
Neurologic: The patient is alert and oriented. 
He has no focal deficits. 
LABS UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 105 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 178 , magnesium 2 , white count 8 , hematocrit 38.5 , hemoglobin 13.6 , platelets 163 , PT 16 , INR 1.3 , PTT 34.9. 
Urinalysis is normal. 
Cardiac catheterization done on 8/28/04 revealed a 90% ostial LAD lesion , 70% ostial ramus , 90% mid D1 , 80% ostial D3 , 75% proximal circumflex , 50% ostial RCA , 90% proximal PDA. 
There was right dominant circulation and 75%-80% right renal artery stenosis. 
He had an ejection fraction of approximately 60%. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to hospital on 4/25/04 and was taken to the operating room on 10/19/04 where he received a five-vessel CABG in which the left internal mammary artery was sewn to the LAD. 
Saphenous vein graft 1 to first diagonal artery. 
Right internal mammary artery was sewn to the ramus. 
The left radial artery was harvested and sewn to LVB2 and LVB1. 
Bypass time was 159 minutes. 
Cross clamp time 111 minutes. 
Postoperatively , he was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit where he was hemodynamically stable. 
He was rapidly weaned of the ventilator without problems. 
He did develop a bout of rapid atrial fibrillation in the first two days postoperatively. 
This was treated by restarting the patient's propafenone , which he was taken preoperatively for atrial fibrillation. 
The patient's other primary issue postoperatively while in the intensive care unit was an episode of oliguria , near anuria. 
A renal consult was obtained at this time. 
He did receive a bilateral renal ultrasound , which showed kidneys to be essentially equal in size with no hydronephrosis. 
He was started on low-dose dopamine and once his systolic pressure went back to his baseline preoperative systolic pressure of approximately 160 , he began to make adequate amounts of urine. 
It was therefore determined that his renal perfusion is largely pressure dependent with him requiring a mean pressure of close to 100. 
He remained hemodynamically stable. 
He did have some constipation , which was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen and subsequently resolved. 
He will be transferred out to the cardiac step-down unit on 9/7/04. 
The remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated at the time of discharge.
