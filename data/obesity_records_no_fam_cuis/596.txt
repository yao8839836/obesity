Burning in chest with activity ( band like , radiating to both shoulders ) releived promptly with rest.

************** Hospital Course*************** 1 ) ISCHEMIA: pt with prior CAD/stent , likely angina 2nd to demand ischemia on decompenasted HF. cont meds , pt not on Plavix on admission. 
Doubt primary angina as couse of CHF/RHF. 2 ) PUMP: Pt with ?dyastolic 
HF with acute decomp/exacerbation ( with dietary indiscretion )- as well as renal failure as poss source of volume overload. 
Change to IV lasix 100 BID and strict I/Os , weights. 
October Pt has responded to BMP diuresis in past. 
Restarted here on BMP w/ limited response. 
Pt achieved -500 ml qd but continued to have weight gain. 
I suspect that fluids were not being acc urately accounted for. 
At this time patient is no longer being effect ively diuresed and will require dialysis for volume overload in a short period of time. 
3 ) RHYTHM: No signs of arhtymias 4 ) RENAL: PT with stage 4 CRI and nephrotic synd. 
May be volume overload 2nd to renal failure in addition to CHF decomp/exacer. 
Cr. 4 at admission but elevated to 5.3. 
Given Pt's current condition , dialysis seems imminent. 
October Pt went for vein mapping but pt remained uncertain if he will accept dialysis as a treatment option.

Pt will have creatnine checked in 2 days and called in to following physician.
