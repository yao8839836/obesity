This was complicated by a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with a troponin level of 12.03 on March . 
The patient then became stable and was discharged to rehab on August . 
On the day of admission , around 3 p.m. , the patient complained of 3/10 chest pain , headache as well as upper extremity pain.

She remained pain free for the entire transport as well as in the Emergency Room. 
She denies any radiation of her pain. 
There was no nausea or vomiting. 
However , given her significant past medical history of coronary artery disease as well as a very recent non-Q wave myocardial infarction , patient was admitted to the General Medicine Service for rule out myocardial infarction. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Most of it is as stated above. 
The patient had a cath in January , 1998 which showed 20% of LAD stenosis , 70% of diagonal branch stenosis , 95% of the left circumflex at the OM2 bifurcation and a stent was placed in the left circumflex. 
Her echo in July of 1998 showed an ejection fraction of 60% with mild AS and normal right ventricle function and size and some left ventricular hypertrophy. 
The patient has a coronary artery disease with a MIBI done in September of 1996 which was notable for inferior ischemia with 5/25 segments. 
In addition to her cardiac history and diabetes history , the patient also has a history of panic attacks.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies any history of smoking or alcohol. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general , patient is a irish speaking elderly woman who does understand some English and was resting comfortably in bed in no acute distress. 
Vital signs , temperature 99.1 , heart rate 67 , blood pressure 170/90 , respiratory rate 16. 
Oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula. 
Skin examination warm , dry. 
HEENT , pupils equal , round , reactive to light with extraocular muscles intact. 
Neck was supple. 
She had JVD of about 8 centimeters. 
Lung examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmur , rub or gallop. 
Abdomen examination reveals positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender in palpation. 
On extremity examination , the patient has a long scar on her right lower extremity with stitches in place as evidence of her recent bypass surgery. 
The wound appears clean with no exudates and no erythema. 
There is some mild edema on the right lower extremity. 
There was no edema on the left lower extremity. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medicine Service for rule out myocardial infarction. 
On the day of admission , while on the floor , the patient had another episode of chest pain or chest pressure. 
However , she reported that this came on after she had eaten her meal and the pain was localized to the epigastrium with no radiation. 
Her electrocardiogram at that time showed no changes. 
She was given some Maalox and this relieved her pain. 
During this hospitalization , the patient did not have any cardiac related chest pain. 
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CK of 48 and then 21 and then 14. 
On admission , she had a troponin level of 0.17 , however , the patient did have a very recent myocardial infarction on March with a troponin level of 12.03. 
It is very possible that her troponin level of 0.17 is just the tail end of a recent myocardial infarction and the level is on it's way down. 
The patient remained chest pain free and afebrile during this entire hospital stay. 
She was stable. 
Her medical management was only changed with Hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. added to her list of medications. 
Per Cardiology , it is okay for patient to go back to Thoeaston Healthcare with the plan that she will need further cardiac studies after she is released from her rehab center. 
PROCEDURES: The patient did have a chest x-ray on admission which showed only mild vascular engorgement and otherwise normal chest x-ray. 
Her electrocardiogram on the 17 of August showed ST depressions in the lateral leads as well as T wave inversion in AVL. 
It was normal sinus rhythm. 
This is basically with no significant changes compared to the electrocardiogram done on February . 
LABORATORY TESTS: Her CBC was normal.
