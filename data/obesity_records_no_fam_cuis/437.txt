SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. 
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. 
3. URINARY TRACT INFECTION. 
4. DIABETES MELLITUS. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who was followed in cardiology by Dr. Service who has presumed diastolic dysfunction , who was in her usual state of health until 1/23 , when she was admitted to the Tonsta Ean Villebaxt Hospital with a flare of Crohn's ileitis. 
At the time of her discharge , she was not restarted on her Lasix and subsequently developed fluid retention with gradual worsening , shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. 
The patient noted a 20 lb weight gain during this period , as well as increasing orthopnea and increasing dyspnea on exertion when getting dressed or doing any different movements. 
She was seen in cardiology clinic on 8/3/02 and found to be in much worse congestive heart failure with new atrial fibrillation. 
She was transferred then to the emergency department here at the I Warho Hospital .  
Her most recent echocardiogram on 4/29/01 revealed mild to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy without any regional wall motion abnormalities. 
Her systolic ejection fraction was estimated to be 60% suggesting a diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. 
She was admitted with volume overload for diuresis. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The review of symptoms was notable for chest tightness with occasional palpitations. 
She experienced no dizziness , no syncope and no recent diarrhea , no abdominal pain , no nausea or vomiting. 
She did report chronic arthritis. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Significant for congestive heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction , ( 2 ) Crohn's colitis diagnosed in 1963 , ( 3 ) Right breast carcinoma stage II previously treated , not currently active , ( 4 ) Diabetes mellitus , ( 5 ) Obstructive sleep apnea , ( 6 ) Gastroesophageal reflux disease , ( 7 ) Hypercholesterolemia , ( 8 ) Osteoarthritis. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a prior tobacco smoker , having smoked two packs per day for 38 years , but has quit.

The patient lives in A Kaneard Au with a friend and is a retired x-ray technician. 
ALLERGIES: The patient's medical allergies include penicillin , which causes a rash , Demerol and Dilaudid causing nausea , and Macrodantin. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Included a temperature of 97 , heart rate 76 , blood pressure 90/60 , respiratory rate 28 , and a saturation of 97% on room air. 
The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation. 
GENERAL: Physical examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented x3 , in no acute distress , having shortness of breath while sitting up in bed. 
HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , and reactive , extraocular movements were intact. 
NECK: Showed jugular venous distention to at least 20 cm. 
CHEST: Showed crackles posteriorly approximately half of the way up. 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Showed an irregular rhythm and a systolic ejection murmur consistent with the prior diagnosis of aortic stenosis. 
ABDOMEN: Showed profound obesity. 
EXTREMITIES: Showed significant pitting edema bilaterally over the calves. 
LABORATORY DATA: Showed a white blood cell count of 7 , hematocrit 31 , platelets of 148. 
Sodium was 142 , potassium 3.9 , BUN 56 , creatinine 1.3 , with a glucose of 75. 
Liver function tests were normal. 
CK was 44 and troponin was 0.02. 
A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion without any evidence of infiltrates. 
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 72 , otherwise no abnormalities beside some nonspecific ST-T wave changes. 
Urinalysis showed evidence of an urinary tract infection with 20-30 white blood cells and was leukocyte esterase positive. 
Urine culture was sent at that time. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Congestive heart failure - The patient was started on IV Lasix along with Zaroxolyn and responded with a brisk diuresis over the course of the admission. 
The patient's weight declined by approximately 5.2 kg. 
It was estimated that the total volume of fluid removed was approximately 15 liters. 
The patient was reported great improvement in her symptoms , was able to ambulate without requiring supplemental oxygen. 
The patient was switched to oral Lasix and continued her diuresis. 
The day prior to discharge , the patient was switched to oral torsemide , and she will be discharged on that medication. 
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient was noted to have new onset of atrial fibrillation while being seen in cardiology clinic on 8/3/02 . 
Since it was not known how long the atrial fibrillation had been going on , a decision was made to anticoagulate the patient. 
She was initially started on intravenous unfractionated heparin while starting anticoagulation with Coumadin. 
The patient reached a therapeutic INR of 2.5 within approximately 4-5 days and the IV heparin was discontinued. 
At the time of discharge , the patient INR was 3.2. 
She will have INR follow up through her primary cardiologist , Dr. Service . 
Currently , the decision to cardiovert the patient is left in the hands of her outpatient cardiologist. 
3. Urinary tract infection - The patient's initial urinalysis indicated a bacterial urinary tract infection. 
Subsequent urine culture grew out E. coli , which was subsequently determined to be resistant to levofloxacin. 
Initially , the patient had been started on IV levofloxacin , which was subsequently changed to p.o. cefixime. 
The patient completed a five-day course of p.o. cefixime while here in the hospital and was discharged on that medicine to complete a 10-day course. 
Of note , the initial symptoms the patient had including hematuria , resolved by the time of discharge. 
4. Diabetes mellitus - The patient has a long history of diabetes requiring insulin treatment. 
She is followed by endocrinologist at the Ainam Iro Hospital .  
During this hospitalization , her blood sugars were maintained with insulin subcutaneous injections. 
The patient is to continue the management of her diabetes per her endocrinologist.
