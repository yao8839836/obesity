773981468 | PUO | 11147158 | | 9141268 | 6/20/2006 12:00:00 AM | WEAKNESS | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 1/30/2006 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 2/2/2006 ATTENDING: THEILING , BREE MD DATE AND TIME OF DEATH: 1/18/06 at 2:20 p.m. CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient was admitted on 2/12/06 with a chief complaint of weakness and confusion. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This was a 70-year-old female with CHF , coronary artery disease , diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency that was admitted on 2/12/06 for weakness and confusion. 
She had been recently hospitalized on 3/25/06 through 10/28/06 and 10/16/06 through 9/4/06 for CHF exacerbation requiring aggressive diuresis. 
Her weight on discharge on 9/4/06 was 85 kg. 
She did well initially at home after discharge , but two days prior to admission , had increasing somnolence and confusion with global weakness causing the patient to fall without head trauma or loss of consciousness. 
The patient had decreased p.o. intake and was febrile to 99.5. 
On admission , her weight was 83.9 kg. 
She was hypotensive with blood pressures of 100/50. 
Her JVP was elevated to 15 and 3+ pitting edema. 
She had a BNP of 2321 and a white cell count of 18.9. 
Assessment: An assessment on admission suggested that the patient possibly had hypoperfusion secondary to over diuresis or worsening heart failure secondary to a cardiac event with a note of having a troponin of 2.61. 
Hospital Course: Her hospital course after admission on 2/12/06 was complicated by worsening cardiac function with minimal improvement on milrinone and decreasing urine output despite diuretics and also gross gastrointestinal bleeding with melanotic stool while she was on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. 
In addition , there was concern for sepsis. 
The patient was on antibiotics with levofloxacin , Flagyl , and vancomycin. 
She required a transfer to the Cardiac Care Unit on 11/19/06 for further medical therapy for poor cardiac output , a possible need for CVVH , given volume overload in the setting of renal failure , and work-up of GIB. 
Her code status was DNR/DNI during her admission into the CCU on 7/25/06. 
The patient reversed her status to DNR , but allowed for elective intubation on 11/19/06 , given her increasing GI bleed and the worsening renal failure. 
The patient was electively intubated on 10/30/06 without any complications. 
For her GI bleed , she had an EGD and colonoscopy , which found a gross large ascending colorectal mass with ulcerations , which likely contributed to her gross GI bleed. 
Given the patient's wishes to be DNR/DNI and given her new finding for a large mass in the ascending colon , the patient's code status was changed to comfort measures only on 4/20/06. 
In addition , her colorectal mass pathology returned showing poorly differentiated tumor with lymphoma versus adenocarcinoma being most likely as the diagnosis. 
For the above reason , the patient was also made CMO. Being CMO status , she was removed of all pressors and antibiotics in the morning of 4/20/06. 
She was made comfortable sedated on fentanyl and Versed. 
She was then extubated for comfort with family present. 
She had agonal breathing with episodes of apnea and was given additional sedation for comfort. 
The patient drew her last breath at 2:20 p.m. 
Her family was present at bedside. 
The attending was aware. 
On assessment , the patient had no spontaneous breathing , no corneal reflex , and no peripheral pulses. 
The patient's eyes were dilated and no heart sounds or breath sounds were appreciated. 
Given the CMO status , no CPR was undertaken. 
The patient was pronounced dead at 2:20 p.m. on 4/20/06. 
Family declined autopsy.
