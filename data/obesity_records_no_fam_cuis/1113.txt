++Mental Status - Avoided increasing narcotics. 
Given lactulose QID. 
Mental status improved significantly in first 24 hours of hospitalization. 
Patient then remained at her baseline mental status for rest of hospital stay. 
++MSK - Patient has history of chronic low back pain that is likely related to bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures seen on MRI on 6/5/06. 
We avoided increasing her narcotic dose for concern of her altered mental status. 
Pain was controlled effectively with MSIR prn , celecoxib daily prn ( should not increase to bid given ? 
increase risk of cardiac side effects ) , and a lidoderm patch over her lower back. 
Other NSAIDS were avoided given h/o GI bleed. 
Patient is scheduled to f/u with Dr. Pidro ( Rheumatology ) for management of her back pain and consideration of sacroplasty. 
Patient should be seen by PT at her nursing home to help her with her walking. 
++GI/ID - Had low-grade fevers overnight on HD 1 and 2. Patient had mild RUQ tenderness which raised a question of possible GI / biliary source of infection. 
Blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph in 2/4 bottles. 
She was treated with Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazol starting on HD 1 , and vancomycin until speciation of blood cultures. 
Blood cultures repeated on 11/18 and 7/27 were negative to date. 
Coag neg staph blood cultures were thought to be due to contamination. 
Patient has remained afebrile and abdominal tenderness has resolved over hospital stay. 
Vancomycin was discontinued on HD 3 and Cipro and Flagyl were continued. 
She was discharged with instructions to complete a 14-day course of Cipro and Flagyl. 
Her WBC count and platelets decreased gradually throughout her hospital stay and were 3.88 and 122 respectively. 
A CBC should be checked on Monday 6/25 to make sure that she is not becoming neutropenic or thrombocytopenic. 
++Pulm - The possibility of PE was considered given lower extremity swelling and her change in mental status. 
Given that she was at her baseline oxygen requirement and had negative LENIs , PE was thought to be low probability. 
She remained at her baseline oxygen saturation ( 93-98% on room air ) for the duration of her hospitalization. 
Given flovent for known COPD. 
++CV - EKG at admission was unchanged from previous EKGs. 
Patient's dose of Lopressor was decreased , given her low BP at time of admission. 
Her heart rate and blood pressure remained in the normal range throughout her admission.
