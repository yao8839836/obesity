INFARCTION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 4/23/1997 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 11/2/1997 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Rathgeb is a 69 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease , status post an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in January 1996. 
She had a cardiac catheterization at the time , which showed an 80% mid left anterior descending artery lesion , and 80% left circumflex lesion before OM1 , 50% proximal right coronary artery lesion , and an 80% posterior left ventricular branch lesion. 
She was also noted to have inferior and anterolateral HK with an ejection fraction of 52%. 
The patient expressed her desire to be managed conservatively , and was medically managed for the following year. 
She had a sub-max exercise tolerance test prior to discharge and one month later had a full BRUCE protocol going six minutes with less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in several leads. 
The patient did well for the past year without symptoms until 1:00 a.m. on the morning of admission when she woke from sleep with substernal chest pain. 
She took sublingual nitroglycerin with relief after half and hour but at 3:00 a.m. the pain recurred with nausea. 
The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin with resolution of the pain by 4:00 a.m. 
She presented to the emergency department free of pain and electrocardiogram at the time showed changes consistent with anterior ischemia. 
The patient was admitted with unstable angina for evaluation. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for coronary artery disease , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s. , sublingual nitroglycerin , enalapril 5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. 
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pulse of 62 , regular and blood pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 12 , oxygen saturation of 99% on three liters nasal cannula. 
There was no evidence of jugular venous distention , carotids 2+ bilaterally , no bruits. 
Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
Heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm and an S4 was present. 
Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender and nondistended with normal bowel sounds present. 
Extremities were without edema. 
LABORATORY DATA: On admission the patient's initial CK was 111. 
Her second CK was 452 , with an MB fraction of 45.1 , third CK was 550 with an MB fraction of 47.9 , and a fourth CK of 439 with MB fraction of 33.5 , fifth CK of 261 , with MB fraction of 14.9 , and a sixth CK of 156. 
SMA seven was normal. 
Troponin I was 0.0 on admission. 
White blood count of 11 , hematocrit 39.7. 
Chest x-ray was unremarkable for any infiltrate or any congestive heart failure evidence. 
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 75 , axis 0 , 2 to 3 ST segment elevation in V1 through V3 , 1 mm elevation in V4 , less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in 1 , AVL , and V5 , V6. These changes were new compared to a previous electrocardiogram from January 1996. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to CCU , at which time she was pain free and her electrocardiogram abnormalities had resolved. 
Her heart rate and blood pressure were controlled with intravenous medications and she was managed medically until hospital day three when she was taken of the cardiac catheterization laboratory. 
Cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% plus left anterior descending artery lesion distal to D1 with evidence of thrombus , 60% proximal left circumflex lesion with diffuse disease in the OM1 , a 40% right coronary artery lesion , left ventriculogram revealed anterior lateral apical and septal HK and AK. 
The patient returned to the cardiac catheterization laboratory the following day for PTCA and stenting of her left anterior descending artery lesion followed by ReoPro infusion. 
From the time of her admission to the Cardiac Care Unit throughout her hospital stay the patient did not have recurrence of her chest pain. 
Cardiac enzymes returned to baseline. 
Electrocardiogram revealed ST segments also returned to baseline. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 11 days , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enalapril 20 mg p.o. q.d. 
The patient is instructed to resume a low fat , low cholesterol diet. 
Activity as tolerated. 
FOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Salvia on 9/21/97 at 3:50 p.m. and will also follow-up with Dr. Forand in the end of August or beginning of April , to be arranged.
