Discharge Date: 1/17/2002 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63 year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease , hypertension , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , aortic stenosis , and status post bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts who presented to the hospital with increasing left lower extremity pain. 
He was taken to angiography at which time tPA infusion was commenced. 
He is most recently status post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of 2001 and has noticed that , in the past two to three weeks , has been developing increasing rest pain and coolness to the left foot to the point where he was not able to ambulate. 
In angiography , he was found to have an occlusion of the left lower extremity vein graft in the area of the mid-thigh with no passage of contrast and minimal reconstitution of collaterals to his foot. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease. 
Myocardial infarction. 
Hypertension. 
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
Aortic stenosis. 
He is status post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of 2001. 
A revision with cephalic vein to dorsalis pedis in July of 2001. 
He is status post a right femoral to peroneal in September of 2000 and a right fourth toe amputation in September of 2000. 
MEDICATIONS: Glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg q.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg q.d. , Amlodipine 5 mg q.d. , Imdur 30 mg q.d. , and Toprol 100 mg q.d. and enteric coated aspirin. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient first underwent angiography at which time they found that the vein graft was occluded. 
He underwent tPA treatment and was brought back to angiography. 
This time they did not find necessarily any improvement. 
The conduit actually opened but it was found that he does have a high grade anastomotic stricture of the distal anastomosis. 
He was taken to the operating room on 10/23/01 for a left lower extremity thrombectomy via groin and foot cutdown. 
Status post that procedure he developed symptoms of acute chest pain and hypotension. 
An ECG was performed , as well as troponin drawn , revealing that he has an acute myocardial infarction. 
The cardiology service was called and the patient was admitted post-thrombectomy to the cardiac care unit. 
At that time he was managed medically for a few days. 
Based on his severe aortic stenosis and difficulty in managing his blood pressure , the cardiac surgery service was consulted. 
He was scheduled to see cardiac surgery in office setting but , given his current condition , we were going to perform his surgery a little bit sooner. 
He did have a bout of pneumonia which mildly delayed his surgery. 
On 1/18/02 he underwent catheterization which revealed a right dominant system , a discreet 40% lesion in the proximal left main , a discreet 30% lesion in the proximal left anterior descending artery , 100% lesion in the first marginal branch of the left circumflex artery , as well as 100% lesion in the second marginal branch of the left circumflex artery. 
He has a discreet 80% lesion in the proximal right coronary artery , as well as evidence of severe aortic stenosis. 
During catheterization this revealed an RA pressure of 10 , a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/20 , with wedge of 31. 
He had a thick cardiac output of 4.77 and cardiac index of 2.1. 
Based on the findings of these catheterization results , the patient was taken to the operating room on 2/13/02 with Dr. Colasamte and Dr. Narvaez for an aortic valve replacement with a #23 Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve and mitral valvuloplasty with an Alfieri suture repair , as well as coronary artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery , left radial to obtuse marginal one , and left radial to posterior descending artery. 
Postoperatively he underwent our routine care and went to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he generally did well. 
He remained on his aspirin and Lopressor , as well as Coumadin. 
He was mildly tachycardic and his Lopressor dose was adjusted. 
Because of his diabetes mellitus , he was placed on the Portland protocol and remained on a full ten-day course of Flagyl and Cefotaxime for his preoperative pneumonia. 
On postoperative day #1 he was transferred to the floor where he did well and was able to ambulate at least to a chair and was deemed that he probably is not a candidate to go home immediately but a candidate for rehabilitation. 
He has been taken off his Portland protocol and his staples have been discontinued. 
On his pre-discharge examination he is stable with clean incisions , as well as stable sternum. 
He is now currently on room air and will be discharged to rehabilitation.
