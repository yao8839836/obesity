HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Phanco is a 72 year old man who is status post a coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement who presents with recurrent unstable angina. 
He was admitted to the Cardiology Service for cardiac catheterization. 
His history began in l976 when he presented with substernal chest pain and shortness of breath. 
In l98l , he experienced an anterior myocardial infarction and in October of l98l , underwent a three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft with mitral valve replacement. 
He did fairly well with no recurrent symptoms until September of l989 when he presented with congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
A thallium exercise treadmill test revealed inferoapical ischemia and the patient was continued with medical therapy. 
He did well until one to two weeks prior to admission when he developed chest pain which radiated to the left arm and was persistent for three hours after which time it was treated with Nitroglycerin at Osri Medical Center and resolved. 
An exercise treadmill test was stopped secondary to shortness of breath and thallium scan revealed inferoapical scarring and septal apical reperfusion abnormality. 
The patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization at Pagham University Of which revealed l00% occlusion of his left anterior descending graft and patent posterior descending artry graft and OM2 graft. 
His native vessels were remarkable for significant disease throughout his left anterior descending , an l00% circumflex lesion at the obtuse marginal l , l00% proximal obtuse marginal lesion , and l00% right coronary artery occlusion. 
Left ventriculogram revealed an ejection fraction of 0.6 with apical hypokinesis. 
The patient was referred to Cardiac Surgery Service for evaluation and coronary artery bypass grafting was elected. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for diet controlled diabetes mellitus , history of an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm , and a hiatal hernia. 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Inderal , Procardia , Aspirin , Lasix , Pepcid , Maalox , Nitrol Paste , and intravenous Heparin. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a longstanding cigarette smoking history which was stopped in l98l. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: As above. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant moderately obese male in no acute distress. 
HEAD/NECK: Within normal limits. 
CHEST: Clear bilaterally. 
CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. 
ABDOMEN: Benign. 
EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis , clubbing , or edema with good peripheral pulses. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia with first degree AV block and right bundle-branch block. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: On July , patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and a left internal mammary artery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well. 
Post-operatively , the patient developed intermittent rhythm disturbances with several episodes of ventricular ectopy and bradycardia which were not felt to be significant enough to warrant further investigation by the Cardiology Service. 
The patient developed a blood culture that was positive for enterobacter and the patient subsequently underwent placement of a Hickman catheter to receive a four week dose of Gentamicin and Ceftriaxone. 
This was well tolerated without complication. 
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. 
The patient is discharged home and will receive a full course of four weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Lopressor , and Pepcid.
