Approximately one month ago , she was standing in her kitchen saying good-bye to her husband at which point she passed out. 
Her husband noted her getting pale and rolling her eyes back , states that this lasted approximately 13 seconds.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Cigarettes one-half pack per day x31 years. 
Alcohol none. 
The patient is on disability. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 98.8 , pulse 96 , blood pressure 120/70 , and respirations 18. GENERAL: In no apparent distress. 
HEENT: Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light. 
Extraocular movements were intact. 
Cranial nerves II-XII normal with bilateral carotid bruits , right more than left. 
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2. No murmurs appreciated. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , and non-distended. 
Bowel sounds positive. 
EXTREMITIES: Without edema and warm. 
LABORATORY DATA: The patient had a sodium of 137 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , bicarbonate 15 , BUN 86 , creatinine 3.1. 
Creatinine on June , 1999 was 2.7 and creatinine on May , 1999 was 3.0. 
ALT was 6 , AST 11 , alkaline phosphatase 44 , bilirubin total 0.4 , direct bilirubin 0.1 , calcium 9.5 , cholesterol 360 , and HDL 40. 
White blood cell count was 7.08 , hematocrit 25.9; on June , 1999 , the patient's hematocrit was 31.9 , and platelets 279. 
Echocardiogram from September of 1999 had moderate to severe left ventricular hypertrophy , ejection fraction of 55% , borderline hypokinetic inferior left ventricular wall , mild mitral regurgitation , and left atrial dilatation. 
Carotid noninvasives from October of 1999 showed no significant right or left internal carotid stenosis. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50 year old woman with a history of end stage renal disease , status post renal transplant in February of 1997 , history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass grafting in 1996 ( left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal ) , now with episodes of rapid heart rate and episodes of skipped beats in association without shortness of breath. 
Also , the patient has had a hematocrit drop from 31 to 26 on admission and a history of blood in stool over the last month. 
The patient was guaiaced on admission and during her stay and remained guaiac negative throughout the whole time. 
The patient was placed on cardiac monitoring and had no events recorded on the monitor. 
On September , 2000 , the patient's hematocrit dropped to 21. 
She was transfused two units of blood and her hematocrit went up to 31. 
An exercise tolerance test MIBI was performed which was negative for ischemia. 
The patient's ejection fraction from the MIBI was approximated to be 69%. 
On August , 2000 , carotid non-invasives were repeated which revealed moderate internal carotid plaque on the right. 
Otherwise , she had mild stenosis of the other arteries. 
An echocardiogram was also performed which revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 65%. 
The patient was taken to Electrophysiology Study on October , 2000 which revealed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with possible right ventricular outflow tract origin. 
It was hoped that she could be maintained on Lopressor and Verapamil. 
Due to the results of this study , the patient was already on Atenolol for Beta blockade and Verapamil was tried. 
However , her blood pressure did not tolerate this medication. 
The day after the electrophysiology procedure on March , 2000 , the patient was orthostatic. 
She was given a 250 cc fluid bolus and encouraged to drink more p.o. fluids and she was discharged in stable condition the next day. 
The patient remained symptom free during the entire hospital course. 
The patient's triglycerides were checked during the hospitalization and found to be very high in the 1 , 500 range. 
The patient was therefore taken off Simvastatin and started on Gemfibrozil.
