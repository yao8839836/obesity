Ms. Tassone cardiac history began in 1995 when she was admitted with worsening dyspnea. 
Echocardiogram at that time revealed an ejection fraction of 15% with global hypokinesis and 3+ mitral regurgitation. 
Catheterization revealed a right dominant system with clean coronary arteries. 
Exercise test at that time revealed a peak VO2 of 12.6 liters per kg per minute. 
IN October of 1997 , a repeat echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with moderate mitral regurgitation and significant left atrial dilatation.

In April of 1997 , she developed progressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and PND. 
In October of 1998 , repeat echocardiogram revealed severe left ventricular dilatation with an EF of 10 to 15% , global hypokinesis and left atrial dilatation secondary to mitral regurgitation. 
She was hospitalized most recently in August 1999 for abdominal discomfort thought to be secondary to worsening right heart failure and improved with aggressive diuresis.
