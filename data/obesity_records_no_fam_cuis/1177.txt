3. The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February , 2003. 
CC: Hypotension after dialysis HPI: 56 yo male with h/o ESRD , CAD , CHF ( EF 20-25% ) admitted for hypotension after HD. He was in his USOH until 2 days PTA when he developed stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough. 
He denied recent travels , and had remote Abx use. 
At Ton Hospital , he had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his BP was 66/30. 1 liter of NS was given and his BP rose to 73/40. 
ROS: Chronic PND , uses 1 pillow , gained 8kg in 2 weeks but compliant with meds , no melena , no BRBPR Physical Exam T 97 p85 BP 114/67-&gt;160/97 rr 16-24 89% RA Chronically ill appearing , NAD Neck: Supple Chest: Bibasilar rales CVS: palpable S3 , Lat displaced PMI , II/VI SEM at RUSB , JVP &lt; 7cm Abd: Soft NT ND , + BS , no HSM Ext: Trace pedal edema , hyperpigmentation in sock distribution Labs: WBC 5 , TnI 0.37 , CK 153 , CKMB8.2 ( chronically elevated cardiac enzymes ) EKG: NSR , 1st deg AVB , LAE , LVH , old TWI in 1 , L , V5 , V6 , more pronounced ST dep in V5 than 9/24 CXR: R pl effusion , CMG Assessment: Hypotension after dialysis in setting of GI upset/diarrhea/vomiting , likely was dehydrated. 
The BP rose after fluids and his current hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema. 
Although chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern about new ishemia , and concern for PE given hypoxia in ED. Hospital course 1. CVS: Ischemia: NSTEMI: contined medical management with asa , beta blocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. 
The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4. His cardiologist ( Dr Stautz ) recommended PET scan to assess for viable myocardium and ischemia. 
His last stress test 1 year ago showed only scarring with no ischemia. 
In the past , pt's wife refused for him to go for CABG. 
They are reconsidering this option currently. 
The results of the PET scan are as follows: - A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mild residual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LAD distribution. 
- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction. 
- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February , 2003. 
The family was called to stress the importance of follow up with cardiology ( They have missed appointments in the past ) Pump: ( EF 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent and pending and echo revealed EF 30% , Mod AI. Rhythm: no events occurred on telemetry 2. Pulm: monitored sats with fluid restriction. 
RA sats improved to 97% 3. Renal: HD MWF , home renal meds. 
He was dialyzed to a weight below his previous baseline per cardiology recommendations. 
In the past he has had elevated RH filling pressures after HD. The Lesum On- Community Hospital was called by the attendting renal physician ( Dr. Bussler ) about his goal weight. 
4. ID: Blood cx were no growth 5. GI: He was continued on his home nexium 6. Proph: SQ heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It is very important that you attend your follow up appointment with the cardiologist , Dr Stautz Please take the medications listed above and do not take enalapril on mornings of dialysis Please adhere to your dietary restrictions. 
If you gain more than 3 kg between dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid intake. 
The diet guidelines will be coordinated by the staff at Ton Hospital DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: see above No dictated summary ENTERED BY: BENADOM , ROMA C. , M.D. ( GE2 ) 1/5/04 @ 11 ****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******
