They were concerned about the healing of her left fibula/tibia fracture. 
--- HPI: The patient is a 72-year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG , chronic kidney disease ( declined HD ) , congestive heart failure ( EF 30% ) , HTN , and hypocalcemia. 
She has also been hospitalized numerous times in the past two years for CHF exacerbations in the setting of NSTEMI. 
She has preferred not to take any of her prescribed medications despite repeated discussions about benefits of decreased mortality , prevention of re-hospitalization , and symptom management. 
In April 2006 she sustained a displaced LLE tib/fib fx after banging her leg into her bed while driving her motorized scooter in her apartment. 
She has been treated by Dr. Verna Eckloff at PUO . 
She initally refused surgical repair and was casted , but subsequent films have shown valgus angulation and poor healing. 
She declined surgery ( and was a high-risk surgical candidate given her multiple comorbidities. 
On 11/27/06 the cast was removed by Dr. Ibey and has been in a walking boot since then. 
She states that she has pain of the left midleg that she has treated with Tylenol and that has limited her ability to try and bear weight.

The family has discussed these symptoms with her PCP.

From there , she will transition to assisted living. 
Over the last few months , she has declined to take any medications or treatment for her chronic kidney disease or cardiac disease. 
This has led to progressive renal disease , electrolyte abnormalities and myopathy.
