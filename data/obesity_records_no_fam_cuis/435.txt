He was sent home on higher doses of his BP meds as well as the addition of HCTZ to his home lasix dose. 
He was also sent home on a 10 day course of cipro for a foley-associated UTI. 
He did well until the day of admission when he felt tired , checked his BP himself at home and found it was 86/41 , so he called his doctor who directed him the the ER. He denies SOB , COP , orthopnea , PND , N/V , abdominal pain , or cough. 
He has had loose stools x 3 days which he believes is because the VNA increased his stool softeners. 
In the ED his BP was 91/60 with a pulse of 60 and he got 1L fluid.

******************** CONSULTANTS: none ******************** IMPRESSION: 68M with fluid-reponsive hypotension in setting of recent aggressive diuresis and blood pressure medicine augmentation. 1 ) CV( p ): Mr. Leichner was felt to be hypotensive from being dry in the setting of overdiuresis and increased stool output. 
His BP was fluid responsive to 1L in the ED , after which he was able to maintain oral hydration. 
His diuretics were held during his hospital stay and his lasix will need to be resumed once he begins to put on water weight ( he may not need the HCTZ , as the synergy of the two diuretics appears to have been too much for him ). 
His ARB was held in the setting of his acute on chronic renal failure and will also need to be resumed once his creatinine improves to his baseline. 
His labetalol dose was also reduced to allow him to mount a heart rate response to hypotension. 
His nifedipine dose stayed the same. 
He was tolerating a regimen of labetalol 100mg PO twice a day and nifedipine 120mg PO once a day on discharge , with systolic blood pressures in the 120-130s. 
2 ) RENAL: as noted above , the patient appeared to be in acute on chronic renal failure from overdiuresis. 
He continued to make good urine output ( 1-2L per day ) and his creatinine trended downward. 
His ARB was held but will need to be restarted as an outpatient. 
3 ) DM: he was maintained on his home regimen of lantus 48 , aspartate qac and slide scale. 
He was on a renal , cardiac , diabetic diet. 
FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 ) Mr. Leichner : your lasix , hydrocholorthiazide , and irbesartan were stopped. 
Your doctor will tell you when to restart the irbesartan ( avapro ). 
Please weigh yourself daily and restart your lasix 80mg once a day if you gain more than 2 pounds. 
2 ) Mr. Leichner : your labetalol is now 100mg twice a day ( was 200mg twice a day ). 3 ) VNA: please check Mr. Leichner blood pressure , heart rate , and weight twice a week and call or fax results to PCP.
