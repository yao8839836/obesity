currently TWI in v1 , v2. ( since CABG , TWI in V1 and V2 come and go ) - CXR: neg. . 
Impression: 62F CAD/CABG , dCHF admitted after presented with chest pressure and worsening of chronic cough with low grade fever. 
Likely combo of URI-triggered asthma cough , gastroenteritis , and ?CHF. unlikely UA. Plan: - Chest pain ( I ): CAD s/p CABG , DM. High risk w/ inc SOB.

Noted to be hypertensive during hospital stay with SBP's in 130-160. 
HR 60-80s. 
Will discharge on increased dose of atenolol ( 100 mg daily instead of 75 mg daily. 
) ( P ): Repeat echo for progressive SOB. 
ddCHF. 
Preserved EF. No wall motion abnormalities or changes suggestive of worsening systolic/diastolic function or ischemia. 
Discharge on home lasix with standing potassium supplementation. 
( R ): Sinus rhythm. 
No events on telemetry. 
T waves in V1-V2 originally noted varied from flat to slightly negative. 
No other dynamic changes. . 
COUGH: Patient gives a history of chronic cough that has recently involved sputum production and low grade fever. 
Her symptoms are consistent with a viral bronchitis with some reactive airway disease. 
She got relief from duoneb and was discharged with a new albuterol inhaler. 
She will also be treated with an empiric course of protonix to treat reflux which may exacerbate reactive airway disease or in itself cause night time cough. 
There was no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. -Sputum gram stain and culture pending at discharge. 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted with concerning changes on your EKG and chest pressure. 
Numerous studies were performed and show that your heart gets adequate blood flow during rest and exercise. 
You did not have any evidence of heart attack either. 
Your cough and chest discomfort are most likely due to an upper respiratory tract infection. 
This may also make your asthma worse. 
We would recommend using your asthma inhaler during the day for cough and wheeze. 
Also we would recommend trying a low dose of stomach acid reducer ( protonix ) as acid reflux can also make cough worse. 
. 
KEY MEDICATION CHANGES: Continue all medicines that you were taking before with the following changes: 1. Atenolol. 
Take 100 mg daily ( increase from 75 mg daily. 
) You were noted to have high blood pressure even on your current dose. 
2. Prilosec. 
Take as directed for 2 weeks. 
This may help your chronic cough. 
3. Albuterol inhaler ( Ventolin. ) Please take as directed. 
4. Robitussion , sugar free. 
Take as directed for cough. . 
Please return to your doctor to check in on how you are doing in the next 2 weeks. 
Return to the ER if you are having difficulty breathing , recurrent chest pain , or other concerning symptoms. 
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable TO DO/PLAN: 1. Followup sputum gram stain/culture. 
2. Blood pressure check on increased dose atenolol. 
3. Cough: improved on albuterol inhaler and proton-pump inhibitor?
