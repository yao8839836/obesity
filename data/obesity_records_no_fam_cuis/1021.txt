Normal active bowel sounds. 
Extremities showed a healing right shin superficial wound , 1+ edema bilaterally. 
Neurologic exam showed mental status , orientation , attention and language intact. 
Speech was low , but not clearly hoarse. 
Cranial nerves right pupil irregular but reacts 2.5 to 2. Left pupil irregular status post iridectomy. 
Visual fields intact. 
Right eye slightly adducted at rest without diplopia. 
Mild decreased abduction and adduction on the right without diplopia , even on extreme gaze. 
No nystagmus. 
Unable to converge fully with the right eye. 
No facial droop. 
Cranial nerves otherwise intact. 
Gag present. 
Able to swallow without difficulty. 
Motor showed normal tone and power to confrontation , symmetric bulk , ? 
slight slowing. 
No clear pronator drift. 
Tendon reflexes trace brachialis , 2+ biceps , no triceps , trace knee reflexes , no ankle jerks. 
Equivocal toes bilaterally. 
Sensation is notable for decreased vibration sense , left greater than right at the toes , intact position sense symmetric. 
Symmetric exam to temperature and light touch. 
? 
cerebellar exam with mild dysmetria on finger to nose on the left , Romberg stable with slight swaying to the left. 
Gait slow with small steps , but fairly steady. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Labs showed sodium 143 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 100 , bicarb 29 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 67 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit 36 , platelets 222 , PT 17 , INR 2.3 , PTT 32. EKG showed atrial fibrillation with no acute changes noted. 
Chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly , no congestive heart failure or infiltrate. 
Head CT showed movement artifact with no obvious CVA , ? 
hypodensity in the right upper pons but likely artifact. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with symptoms of vertical diplopia and unsteadiness/imbalance , falling to the left , with improvement overnight. 
Patient still had an abduction defect with her right eye on the morning after admission and mild leftward gait unsteadiness , but her vertical diplopia had resolved. 
The patient was continued to be monitored. 
Her blood pressure was followed. 
Patient was kept on Coumadin. 
Patient was scheduled for an open air MRI , given her significant size. 
Patient was scheduled for an open MRI at the MRI in Ron Ston Sa , Georgia On 3 of August , patient underwent MRI with particular interest in visualization of the posterior fossa. 
No acute infarct or hemorrhage was noted on MRI MRA. 
The patient was continued on her Coumadin. 
Coumadin had been increased from admission dose of 17 mg to 18 mg p.o. q.p.m. 
Initially , her INR went down slightly on 3 of August to 1.7 , likely secondary to a missed dose earlier in the week. 
On 17 of July , patient reported feeling back to her baseline of one week ago. 
Patient denied any new symptoms. 
Patient denied further imbalance or vertical diplopia. 
Patient was thought to have had a likely small vessel cerebral infarct and , although no stroke was demonstrated on MRI , involvement of patient's left side suggested a cerebral lesion in the brain stem in order to explain the diplopia. 
Patient probably had a very small vessel stroke/TIA. 
Patient has known major risk factors for both small vessel and large vessel and cardioembolic disease. 
Patient was discharged to continue further risk factor modification in the outpatient clinic. 
Patient is to continue her cardiac medical regimen. 
Patient will continue with Coumadin for a goal INR of 2-3 for her chronic atrial fibrillation. 
Patient was discharged on 5 of March She was instructed to call KTDUOO on Monday morning to schedule an appointment with her primary care physician within the next 10 days. 
Patient is discharged in stable condition. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amitriptyline 50 mg p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.day , diltiazem CD 180 mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Relafen 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin 70/30 134 units subcu q.a.m. , insulin 70/30 84 units subcu q.p.m. , Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o. q.week , Coumadin 18 mg p.o. q.p.m. , instructions to be further adjuster as per INR in outpatient clinic.

2. Patient instructed to call KTDUOO at 459-7195 on Monday , 2 of May and scheduled to follow up with primary physician within 10 days of discharge.
