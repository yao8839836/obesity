The patient , again , is a 62 year old , and is a patient of Dr. Castillanos , with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension , diabetes , elevated cholesterol , a positive family history , and being a postmenopausal woman. 
She first noted exertional substernal chest pain about four months prior to admission. 
The pain radiates to her left arm , and is associated with shortness of breath , but no diaphoresis or nausea or vomiting. 
The pain is relieved by rest within two minutes , or by a sublingual Nitroglycerin , which she has used in the past week x two.

The patient had one episode of pain at rest three nights prior to admission. 
She denies shortness of breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 
She was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction on August , 1995 , and ruled out by enzymes and electrocardiogram.

She had 2+ mitral regurgitation , 1+ aortic regurgitation , and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation. 
The day prior to admission , she underwent an exercise tolerance test. 
She went two minutes on standard Bruce protocol , stopped secondary to diaphoresis and shortness of breath without chest pain , and she had nondiagnostic electrocardiogram changes. 
The patient was admitted for premedication for her dye allergy and subsequently catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was catheterized on March , 1995 , with results showing proximal left anterior descending stenosis of 50 percent , mid left anterior descending stenosis of 70 percent. 
The distal left anterior descending was diffusely diseased , and her first diagonal showed a discrete stenosis of 80 percent. 
On the right , she had in the proximal right coronary artery a discrete lesion of 50 percent , and in the mid right coronary artery diffusely diseased at 50 percent. 
The patient underwent successful balloon angioplasty of the mid left anterior descending artery stenosis from 70 percent to 10 percent. 
The patient's post catheterization course was complicated by a loss of 150 cc of blood after her right groin sheath was removed , but the bleeding was stopped after 90 minutes of compression.
