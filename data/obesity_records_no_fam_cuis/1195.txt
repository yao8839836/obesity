The patient was doing very well. 
He was followed biannually by Dr. Fournier Recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 65% with the graft intact. 
The patient noted several episodes of light-headedness over the last several weeks. 
Most recently while playing tennis he collapsed; however , denied loss of consciousness. 
He denied palpitations. 
The patient was seen today in Dr. Berezny clinic where he had a ETT test which was stopped secondary to runs of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

Extremities: No edema.

LABORATORY: Sodium 141 , creatinine 1.0 , white count 8.6 , platelet count 186 , 000. 
His echocardiogram in October 1999 showed an ejection fraction of 65% , normal homograft function. 
His Holter monitor showed sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs and some couplets. 
His ETT done in clinic showed he did eight minutes and 33 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol. 
He had three beats of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , asymptomatic. 
Peak heart rate was 150 , peak blood pressure 182 systolic. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology Service. 
His hypertensive medications were continued. 
The patient had a repeat echocardiogram confirming that he had normal valve function. 
The patient's echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction around 50% which revealed AI , no valve dysfunction. 
His QT interval remained normal on his EKG. 
The patient underwent both a left heart catheterization to rule out significant coronary artery disease as well as an EP study on 10/21/99. 
The patient's catheterization showed normal vessels , ejection fraction of 55%. 
His EP study showed normal AV function , no inducible SVT. 
Repeated , new runs of nonsustained monomorphic as well as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , some observed on the ETT test. 
The recommendations were to start a betablocker and place an ICD. 
On June , 1999 , the patient had an ICD placed without any complications. 
The patient remained asymptomatic during his hospital stay. 
He had no episodes of syncope.

He has a follow up appointment with Dr. Fiermonte as well as to follow up with the EP service with Dr. Aroyo within one month. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams q.d. , Atenolol 50 milligrams q.d. , Vasotec 5 milligrams b.i.d. and Keflex 250 milligrams q.i.d. for three days.
