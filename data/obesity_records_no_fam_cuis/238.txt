295659539 | PUO | 66600893 | | 2491787 | 7/12/2005 12:00:00 AM | CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 3/9/2005 Report Status: Signed 

Discharge Date: 1/21/2005 ATTENDING: HAUB , PERRY M.D. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: This is the diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is sinus arrest with apnea. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ( EF of 55% on this admission , although prior admission indicating an EF of 35% ) , diabetes , obstructive sleep apnea , obesity hypoventilation syndrome , atrial flutter status post ablation. 
On 5/24/05 , he presented with shortness of breath as well as a witnessed apneic episode. 
His recent history is significant for having stopped his Lasix dose one week prior to admission due to increased frustration with incontinence. 
Since then , he has had increasing shortness of breath , orthopnea , bilateral lower edema , and dyspnea on exertion to the point of symptoms upon walking 10 feet. 
In the Pagham University Of Emergency Department , he was found to be saturating 91% on room air and 99% on a nonrebreather. 
An ABG showed a pH of 7.31 and a PCO2 of 55; he was tried on BiPAP without improvement in either PCO2 or PO2. 
While being interviewed by the medical residents , he was seen to have a 30-second apneic episode with loss of consciousness and cyanosis; his sensorium quickly returned after this event , although he retained no memory of this occurrence. 
He received Lasix 80 mg x1 , Solu-Medrol , and DuoNebs in the ED. He was admitted to the CCU initially with CHF/apnea/sinus arrest , and subsequently transferred to the hospital floor when he was stable. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy , 2/13 echo with an EF of 35% and global left ventricular hypokinesis; 7/18 echo with an EF of 55% , without hypokinesis. 
2. Atrial flutter , status post ablation ( 2003 ). 3. Atrial fibrillation. 
4. Hyperostosis frontalis. 
5. Complex renal cyst versus angiomyolipoma , resected via laparoscopy in 8/2 .  
6. Morbid obesity with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. 
7. Obstructive sleep apnea. 
8. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 2 ). 
MEDICATIONS: 1. Allopurinol. 2. Iron. 3. Lisinopril. 4. Toprol-XL. 5. Coumadin ( discontinued on 11/28/05 ). 6. Albuterol inhaler p.r.n. 7. Aspirin. 
8. Flomax. 
9. Hytrin. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone at E He is a retired Kpep Highway , Nashouversa Troit Walk , Connecticut 83407 employee. 
He is an ex-smoker , quit in the 1960s. 
He is a heavy drinker in his 20s , but now he rarely drinks alcohol. 
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature of 96 , pulse of 53 , blood pressure of 125/65 , and saturating 94% on 2 liters by nasal cannula. 
In general , alert and oriented , in no acute distress. 
HEENT: Pupils are equally round and reactive to light , sclerae are anicteric , moist mucous membranes. 
Cardiovascular exam: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , although JVP difficult to assess due to body habitus. 
Lung exam: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no wheezes or crackles. 
Abdomen: Obese , soft and nontender , normal abdominal bowel sounds. 
Extremities: 2+ edema. 
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION: Notable for creatinine of 2.3 ( at baseline ) , BNP of 500. 
His admission EKG: Sinus rhythm with occasional bradycardia to the 40s , no ST changes. 
SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE: Assessment and Plan: A 71-year-old female with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome , restrictive lung disease , diabetes , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , who was admitted for congestive heart failure , sinus arrest , ultimately treated with diuresis and a pacemaker placement. 
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: No active issues during this hospitalization. 
Pump: The patient had a history nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , ( an echo during this hospitalization revealed an EF of 55% without hypokinesis , although prior echo in 2003 showed an EF of 35% with global left ventricular hypokinesis ). 
On admission , the patient had signs and symptoms of volume overload in a setting of having not taken his Lasix for about a week. 
He was admitted initially to the CCU , and subsequently transferred to the floor , with aggressive diuresis of approximately 10 kg since admission ( including diuresis with ultrafiltration in the CCU ). 
Following transfer to the floor , he was switched to Lasix diuresis , which was titrated down gradually to 40 mg daily , ( cautioned with administration giving a rise in creatinine ). 
The patient was also maintained on captopril , which was up titrated to 25 mg t.i.d. ( held at one point due to the rise in the creatinine ). 
The patient was also titrated up on metoprolol to 25 mg b.i.d. 
Rhythm: The patient was followed by the Electrophysiology Service. 
In the CCU , he was noted to have sinus arrest of 8-9 seconds in the setting of apnea. 
Following transfer to the floor , he was noted to have sinus arrest of 4 seconds , again in the setting of apnea. 
His last such episode was on 8/16/05 .  
In addition , the patient has history of atrial fibrillation/flutter , status post ablation. 
On 4/30/05 , he underwent pacemaker placement through cephalic veins , which he tolerated well. 
2. Pulmonary: The patient , as noted above , had several episodes of apnea , some of which were associated with sinus arrest. 
Following diuresis , the patient's apnea episodes improved. 
He was recommended for formal sleep study as an outpatient. 
3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine roughly around baseline ( 2 ) , which rose briskly during his hospitalization to a peak of 3.2 on 4/30/05 .  
His FENa on admission was 6-8%; a repeat FENa in the setting of his peak serum creatinine of 3.2 and following 10 kg of diuresis was 1.86%. 
His urine eosinophils were negative. 
His UA showed evidence of a UTI plus triple phosphate crystals; urine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of mixed morphology. 
It was thought that the rise in the patient's creatinine was likely due to a combination of intravascular depletion and possibly UTI. 
The patient was started on antibiotics following his pacemaker placement , which would be expected to cover GU microbial flora and SNHU microbes. 
4. Endocrine: The patient had a history of diabetes and was maintained on a Regular Insulin sliding scale. 
5. ID: The patient was expected to having an UTI as noted above. 
Following his pacemaker placement , he was placed on cefazolin while in-house , followed by Keflex. 
The patient should stay on Keflex for four days.
