Discharge Date: 2/4/1992 PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. 
OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1. STATUS POST ATHERECTOMY COMPLICATED BY REOCCLUSION AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. 2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS. 
3. ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59 year old female with multiple cardiac risk factors who presents with exertional chest discomfort and early positive ETT. 
The patient has a history of cardiac risk factors of obesity , diabetes mellitus , and cholesterol. 
The patient describes a 6-month history of exertional angina described as chest heaviness with mild shortness of breath whenever she walked more than one block or climbed stairs. 
The patient is followed by Dr. Rossie K Mankoski , LMD at Barbto Be Medical Center .  
She had an ETT on 5/23/92 , modified Bruce protocol , in which she went 2 minutes and 2 seconds , stopped secondary to typical anterior chest discomfort. 
The heart rate was 135 , 83% predicted. 
EKG changes were significant for 20 mm horizontal ST depressions in 1 , V4-5 , 1 mm ST depressions in II , III and F. The patient was referred for cardiac catheterization. 
The patient denies orthopnea , PND , and has mild occasoinal hypertension. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus , oral agent times six months. 
Asthma , no recent symptoms. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucotrol 7.5 mg p.o. q-day , Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Isoril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Propranolol 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. 
ALLERGIES: ? 
ALLERGY TO UNRECALLED ANTIBIOTIC. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 140/70 , pulse 70. 
Neck: negative JVD , 2+ carotids , without bruits. 
Chest: Clear to auscultation. 
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , a I/IV systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right sternal border. 
Abdomen: Plus bowel sounds , nontender. 
Extremities: +2 femorals , no bruits , positive left DP , trace PT , right positive 2 DP and plus 2 PT. LABORATORY EXAMINATION: BUN/creatinine 12/1.2 , glucose 318 , hematocrit 42.3 , white blood cell count 8.38 , cholesterol 222 , triglycerides 173. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent catheterization on 1/15/92 .  
She had a proximal 95% LAD lesion and diagonal 1 40% stenosis. 
She had an anomalous posterior circumflex with luminal irregularities. 
Her mean RA was 5 , and her mean capillary wedge pressure was 11. 
Her cardiac output was 6.2 , wifh an FCR of 1226. 
The patient underwent athrectomy of her proximal LAD lesion through a 10 French arterial sheath. 
The stenosis was reduced from an 80% to 20% residual. 
The Heparin was shut off , and sheaths were pulled later that afternoon. 
Her post atherectomy course was complicated on the evening of 11/12/92 by the onset of severe chest discomfort. 
The patient had significant flipped T-waves in III and F and 2 mm ST depressions as well in III and F. The patient was subsequently brought to the cath lab on 11/12/92 where the LAD was found to be 100% occluded and was dilated to a 30% residual with balloon PTCA. 
Thrombus was found at the prior athrectomy site. 
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit after the PTCA which she proceeded to rule in for a myocardial infarction with peak CPK's of 1390 with MB's of 55. 
The patient's post PTCA course was complicated by several episodes of transient chest discomfort which was relieved both by Mylanta and sublingual TNG. 
These episodes were not compared with EKG nor felt to be secondary to recurrent dyspepsia. 
The patient on 2/9/92 , seven days post MI , had a modified Bruce ETT where she went 9 minutes without any ischemic changes. 
The patient's blood sugars remained elevated throughout her hospital course. 
She was maintained on Glucotrol with NPH subcu q.a.m. was added with the hope that the patient would eventually after the stress of her MI , her blood sugars would return to prior levels. 
The patient was thus treated with Mevacor for hypercholesterolemia. 
The patient was discharged in good condition on 10/10/92 with followup with Dr. Sakumoto in Colnley Mor Health .  
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q-day , Aspirin one p.o. q-day , Glucotrol 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 26 units subcutaneously each morning.
