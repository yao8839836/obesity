HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light. 
Extraocular movements intact. 
Jugular venous distention 15 centimeters , no lymphadenopathy. 
Lungs decreased breath sounds at base with bilaterally crackles on the left a third of the way up. 
Cardiovascular - tachycardic , normal S1S2. 
Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. 
Extremities 3+ lower extremity edema to the mid thigh. 
Venous stasis changes on the shins. 
Neuro nonfocal. 
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 103 , WBC 5.5 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 37.6 , CK 113 , Troponin 1.03. 
Chest x-ray - left-sided pleural effusion. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Joy Hollis Carransa was admitted for increasing cough , left lower extremity edema for presumed congestive heart failure exacerbation. 
Hospital course by systems: 1 ) Cardiovascular. 
The patient was noted to be in new onset congestive heart failure. 
He was aggressively diuresed. 
It was noted on admission that patient was in atrial flutter with pacing at a rate of approximately 110-120. 
An electrophysiology consult was obtained and pacer was interrogated and mode changed to DDI from DDD. 
The patient was loaded on digoxin and subsequently spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm. 
2 ) Pulmonary. 
The patient was noted to have a persistent pleural effusion that was new since the patient's coronary artery bypass graft one month previous. 
Although it was suspected that this was likely secondary to congestive heart failure or perhaps postoperative pleural effusion , etiology was unclear. 
A pulmonary consult was obtained. 
The patient did undergo a diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis of 500 cc of fluid. 
Analysis of the fluid showed a pH of 7.48 , total protein of 4.8 ( serum total protein 7.6 ) , LDH of 158 ( serum LDH 228 ) , glucose 135 , amylase 33 with 600 white blood cells , 6 polys , 0 bands , 56 lymphs , 13 monos , 18 macrophages and 7 , 000 red blood cells. 
No PMNs were noted. 
Cytology was still pending at the time of discharge. 
Though the pleural effusion did meet criteria for an exudate , this was difficult to interpret in light of the patient's recent aggressive diuresis. 
As fluid did not appear to be inspected. 
A PPD with control was planted which was negative , however controls were also anergic. 
Sputum cultures were negative. 
It was felt that the patient would likely benefit from repeat thoracentesis to remove enough fluid so that subsequently chest CT could be performed. 
This was to be pursued as an outpatient. 
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on 7/27/99 with a home VNA and physical therapy services for vital signs monitoring and post coronary artery bypass graft rehab services. 
FOLLOWUP: The patient was to follow up with Dr. Hernandes on 3/5/99 in the chest diseases clinic , as well as with Dr. Fiermonte , his outpatient cardiologist. 
He was also to be seen in Coumadin clinic.

a.m. , 10 units q.
