OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS: Familial cardiomyopathy. 
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old  man with familial cardiomyopathy and a last ejection fraction of 50% well known to the heart failure service secondary to multiple admissions for decompensated CHF in the setting of poor medical and dietary compliance presents with gradual fatigue and increasing abdominal girth , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and feeling "fluid overloaded."

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 , Isordil 30 t.i.d. , spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide 200 p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 20 once a day , and folate 5 once a day. 
ALLERGIES: ACE inhibitors cause a cough and rash and lisinopril causes cough. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smoked 2 packs per day times approximately 10 years and drinks occasional ethanol. 
He denies any history of other drug use. 
He is married and is with 2 children. 
He does not work currently secondary to his cardiomyopathy. 
He also has a brother who is status post cardiac transplant. 
EXAMINATON DATA: Temperature 96 , Pulse 97 , blood pressure 90/70 , and oxygen saturation 97 on room air. 
Admission weight 83.8 kilograms. 
JVP was greater than the angle of the jaw. 
Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. 
Respiratory exam showed a few bibasilar rales. 
Abdomen was distended with mild shifting dullness. 
There was trace bilateral extremity edema. 
LABORATORY VALUES: Creatinine 1.5 , sodium 129 , potassium 2.7 , magnesium 2.2 , ALT 32 , AST 31 , hematocrit 40.6 , white blood cell count 7.3 , platelets 281 , INR 1.2 , PTT 35.4 , and BNP 594. 
INITIAL ASSESSMENT: This is a 36-year-old man with familial cardiomyopathy admitted for CHF exacerbation. 
Problem#1. 
Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted in decompensated failure. 
He reports compliance with his medications; however , likely some component of this decompensation is secondary to dietary indiscretion with foods and fluids. 
The patient was diuresed during his hospital stay initially with intravenous torsemide; however , this was unsuccessful and a Lasix drip with BNP drip was started on hospital day #3. 
He reached a total weight loss of approximately 2 to 3 kilograms and was converted to oral medicines including torsemide. 
Moreover , he failed to maintain a stable weight on this regimen and ultrafiltration was attempted. 
That removed approximately 900 cc of fluids. 
This failed secondary to intravenous access clotting and the patient's frustration with having to lying still. 
The patient was subsequently converted to oral torsemide and metolazone , torsemide 200 b.i.d. , metolazone 5 b.i.d. , and spironolactone 25 b.i.d. as an oral regimen. 
Per the patient's request and reaching a somewhat adequate goal with this hospitalization , the patient requested to be discharged. 
He reported that he would follow up with the CHF nursing staff and with Dr. Lyn and although we repeatedly stressed the importance of free water restriction and fluid restriction , he continued to be noncompliant with this while inhouse. 
At the time the patient was discharged , it was felt that he was not optimal hemodynamically , but had excellent followup plans and stated that he would return if his condition worsened. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 once a day , Isordil 10 t.i.d. metolazone 5 b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide 200 b.i.d. , and K-Dur 60 b.i.d. 
There are no pending studies at the time of discharge. 
The patient will follow up with the CHF nurse in approximately 2 days and see Dr. Lyn in clinic within 1 week.
