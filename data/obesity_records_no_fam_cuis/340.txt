She was treated for pulmonary edema with IV nitroglycerin , Lasix , aspirin , heparin , beta-blockers , and then she was taken urgently to the cath lab where coronary angiography revealed a left main coronary artery thrombosis with proximal and distal stenoses of about 70% , 50% of her LAD , and 60% of her first diagonal. 
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit after placement of an intraaortic balloon pump for further management and evaluation.
