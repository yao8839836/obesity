5. HYPERTENSION. 
6. DYSLIPIDEMIA.

9. GOUT. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 48 year old gentleman with cardiac risk factors including diabetes; adult onset , hypertension , positive family history , dyslipidemia , and also with a distant tobacco use history and with severe obesity. 
The patient has a long history of coronary artery disease starting in 1989. 
The patient presented with angina and ruled out for a myocardial infarction at that time. 
In 1991 he had unstable angina. 
A catheterization revealed 100% LAD lesion proximally , 60% D-1 , 70% distal left circumflex , and normal right coronary artery. 
PTCA to the LAD was performed with 30% residual lesion. 
In 1992 the patient had two myocardial infarctions. 
In February of 1992 a re-catheterization showed an additional lesion of an OM-2 with 60% complex lesion with a mid LAD total occlusion with right-to-left collaterals and diffuse PDA disease. 
In February of 1992 a repeat catheterization was performed for continued unstable angina and the patient had an 80% left circumflex lesion , a 70% OM-2 , 100% proximal LAD , 70% distal left circumflex , 70% OM-2. 
Over this time period between 1991 and 1992 , the patient had a total of four myocardial infarctions including a large anterior wall myocardial infarction. 
The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in February of 1992 which was complicated by ventricular fibrillation arrest in the postoperative Intensive Care Unit. 
The patient received a LIMA to the LAD , SVG to the OM-1 and an SVG to the OM-2. 
The patient had a repeat catheterization in February of 1994 for unstable angina which showed diffuse native disease: 100% LAD with right-to-left collaterals , 70% distal left circumflex , 100% proximal OM-1 , 100% OM-2 , 50% mid right coronary artery. 
The grafts were patent. 
Since that time the patient has had minimal chest pain. 
The patient was seen in the clinic most recently in January of 1997 for exertional chest pain. 
The patient did well with an increase in his Atenolol dose. 
On the day of admission today , for this admission , the patient experienced chest burning at rest while watching TV with no emotional or exertional stress. 
The pain lasted 40 minutes , radiating to the jaw with an intensity of 8 out of 10. 
The patient took a shower without relief , took five sublingual Nitroglycerin tablets without relief. 
The patient presented to the Emergency Ward where his pain was relieved in the Waiting Room. 
The patient had no nausea or vomiting , diaphoresis or shortness of breath. 
The patient has had no increasing dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea or PND recently; however the patient is not physically active. 
Of note , an echocardiogram in 1993 showed an ejection fraction of 40% with apical akinesis and septal hypokinesis. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese , pleasant male in no distress. 
Vital signs: Temperature 97.6 , pulse 88 , blood pressure 127/64 , respirations 18 , oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. 
JVP was eight centimeters. 
There was a normal S1 and S2. 
There was a positive S4 , no S3. 
There was a 1/6 holosystolic murmur with no radiation. 
Left basilar crackles were noted. 
There was a large abdomen with good peripheral pulses. 
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , BUN 18 , creatinine 0.8 , CK 370 , MB 9.1 , troponin 0.21. 
White blood cell count 13 , 000 , hematocrit 45.7 , platelet count 253 , 000 , INR 2.4 , PTT 37.6. 
The patient's chest x-ray was of poor quality , with no congestive heart failure and mild cardiomegaly , and bibasilar atelectasis. 
The patient's EKG had a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 75 , Q waves in III and aVF , V1 and V2. ST elevations in III and aVF of one millimeter , ST depressions and T wave inversions in I and L , but no changes when compared to the patient's baseline EKG. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction , and given his extensive history of previous coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting , it was felt most likely that the patient is now developing an occlusion of his grafted vessels versus occlusion of his right coronary system. 
The patient's peak CK was 370 with positive MB. 
The patient was continued on aspirin , Lopressor , Captopril , Simvastatin , and IV heparin , and Nitropaste sliding scale. 
The next morning the patient was taken to the Catheterization Lab where the previous native disease was noted , but additional disease of the RCA with serial mid 90% lesions , which were stented , a PDA of serial 70 and 90% lesions were dilated. 
The patient was placed on Ticlid. 
The patient experienced no chest pain after the procedure and EKGs had shown no changes after the procedure. 
A submax Bruce protocol exercise treadmill test was negative prior to discharge. 
ENDOCRINE: The patient has a diagnosis of diabetes and his Metformin was held before the catheterization procedure , and the patient was continued on insulin sliding scale and his Glyburide without complications. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day. 2 ) Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q day. 
3 ) Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4 ) Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets q.5 minutes x three; one tablet p.r.n. chest pain. 
5 ) Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6 ) Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 14 days. 
7 ) Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q day. 
8 ) Lisinopril 500 mg p.o. q day. 
9 ) Coumadin 12.5 mg p.o. q day. 
The patient is to return to work in three weeks. 
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY WITH STENT PLACEMENT. 
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition on discharge was stable. 
DISCHARGE DIET: The patient's discharge diet was a low-cholesterol low-fat diet , ADA 1800 calorie diet. 
COMPLICATIONS: None. 
FOLLOW-UP PLANS: The patient will follow-up with his primary cardiologist , Dr. Theiling , and internist , Dr. Irving Escalante .
