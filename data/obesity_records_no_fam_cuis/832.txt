HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Verjan is a 65-year-old gentleman with history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , dyslipidemia , and peripheral vascular disease who presented to Norap Valley Hospital on 5/23/06 with unstable angina. 
The patient reports that he had been having intermittent left-sided chest pressure at rest over the past three days associated with shortness of breath , each episode lasting approximately 10 minutes. 
EKG on admission revealed sinus tachycardia with a new incomplete left bundle-branch block and downsloping 1-1.5 mm ST depressions in V3 through V6 and 1 mm depression in aVL. 
The patient was deemed to have a NSTEMI and unstable angina. 
He was not heparinized due to the fact that he was on Coumadin for peripheral vascular disease with a therapeutic INR. 
On 11/26/06 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed the following: Left circumflex coronary artery with an ostial 100% stenosis , left anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal 60% stenosis and a mid 50% stenosis , right coronary artery with a proximal 80% stenosis and a mid 60% stenosis , right dominant circulation , ejection fraction of 30% , collateral flow from the second diagonal to the third marginal in the right posterior left ventricular branch to the second marginal , left ventricular hypokinesis , severe inferior and apical. 
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 87 , troponin 0.48 , history of class IV angina with inability to carry on any physical activity , history of class II heart failure with slight limitation of physical activity , congestive heart failure , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , dyspnea on exertion , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , status post bilateral fem-pop bypass and status post bilateral transmetatarsal amputations , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , history of gastrointestinal bleeding , anxiety disorder , eosinophilia , chronic back pain , anemia.

Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally. 
Allen's test of the left upper extremity , abnormal intermittent waveform with radial occluded using a pulse oximeter , right upper extremity abnormal poor intermittent wave form with the radial occluded , also with a pulse oximeter. 
Physical exam otherwise is noncontributory. 
ADMISSION LABS: Sodium 128 , potassium 4.2 , chloride of 99 , CO2 21 , BUN of 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose of 201 , magnesium 1.7 , WBC 5.81 , hematocrit 28.6 , hemoglobin 10.2 , platelets of 132 , PT of 18.2 , PT/INR 1.5 , PTT of 33.7.

Total bypass time was 55 minutes , total crossclamp time was 46 minutes. 
The patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and in stable condition. 
Postoperatively , the patient did well.

The patient was extubated on 1/5/06. 
The patient was also followed by the Diabetes Mellitus Service for his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 
His blood glucoses were well controlled. 
He was started back on his oral medication of glipizide 5 mg and was covered with a NovoLog sliding scale. 
The patient was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells postoperatively , and was re-started on Coumadin for his peripheral vascular disease. 
The patient's platelet count dropped to as low as 59 , 000. 
He had a HIT panel sent off which came back negative and platelets trended up at time of discharge to 143 , 000. 
Mr. Verjan was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #3. 
His pacing wires were removed , and he was screened for rehabilitation for discharge. 
The patient also had some urinary retention postoperatively and did require Foley reinsertion and was started on Flomax 0.4 mg once a day.
