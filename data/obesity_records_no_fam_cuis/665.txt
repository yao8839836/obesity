PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Volume overload. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Stewardson is a 74-year-old female with congestive heart failure , aortic stenosis , obesity , hypoventilation syndrome on BiPAP at night , diabetes who presents from rehabilitation with a 12 kg weight gain since the end of October 2006. 
Her last admission to Pagham University Of was complicated by a pCO2 of 80 requiring an ICU stay and noninvasive ventilation. 
Moreover , the patient had a gastrointestinal bleed and hematocrit to a level of 24. 
GI consultant felt that due to the patient's comorbidities and difficulty intubating the patient , she would not be a candidate for either colonoscopy or EGD. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 1.2-1.7 ). 2. Crohn's in remission. 
3. Gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin. 
4. Congestive heart failure. 
5. Aortic stenosis. 
6. Restrictive lung disease likely secondary to obesity. 
7. Diabetes. 
8. Arthritis. 
9. Spinal stenosis. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. 
Right mastectomy. 
2. Two knee replacements. 
3. Two laminectomies. 
4. Gallbladder removal. 
5. Exploratory laparotomy for chronic abdominal pain without findings. 
6. D&amp;C. 
ALLERGIES: 1. Heparin ( heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ). 2. Aspirin. 
3. Demerol. 
4. Codeine. 5. Dilaudid. 
6. Ciprofloxacin. 7. Macrodantin. 
8. Penicillin. 
PREVIOUS STUDIES: 1. Echocardiogram 7/7/2005: Ejection fraction 65-70% , mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , aortic valve was thickened , stenotic , peak gradient 58 ( mean 33 ) , AVA 0.74 , mild mitral regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation ( regurgitant velocity 3.2 m/s , pulmonary artery systolic pressure 40+ right atrial pressure ) , trace-to-mild pulmonic regurgitation. 
2. Pulmonary function test 2/8/2006: FVC 31% , FEV1 23 percent , FEV1/FVC 77%. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , 5/25/2006 , the patient's weight on admission was 130 kg. 
Her vital signs are as follows , temperature 95.8 , pulse 67 in atrial fibrillation , blood pressure 126/Doppler , the patient had respiratory rate of 20 and an O2 saturation 95% on 4 liters. 
In general , the patient was in no acute distress , speaking in full sentences. 
Examination of the neck revealed JVP to the ear , weak/weight carotid upstrokes , no bruits. 
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm with an S1 and weak S2. 
A 4/6 crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur was heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids. 
Lung examination revealed crackles that heard at the way up bilaterally with decreased breath sounds throughout. 
The patient's abdomen was obese , but soft and nontender. 
Examination of her extremities revealed a parvus at tardus. 
Lower extremity pulses could not be palpated due to edema. 
The patient had 4+ lower extremity edema. 
Examination of the left shin showed erythema , pain , swelling with a 2 x 2 cm ulcer on the left anterior shin. 
The ulcer appeared clean , dry and intact with no drainage. 
STUDIES AT OIUH: 1. EKG on 5/25/2006 showed atrial fibrillation at 63 beats per minute with a normal axis and poor R-wave progression. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. 
The patient presented in gross volume overload: We attempted to diurese the patient with intravenous torsemide. 
Gradually , the dose of torsemide was increased from 100 twice a day to 200 twice a day. 
At the time of this dictation; however , the patient's weight had decreased only to 124.6 kg. 
Her admission weight on 7/15/2006 was 130 kg. 
However , this weight was recorded in the bed ( not standing ). 
Her first standing weight was recorded on 8/19/2006 at 125 kg. 
Her lower extremity edema only mildly improved , however , at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to put her shoes on , which she was unable to do prior to admission. 
During this diuresis , the patient's potassium was repleted twice a day. 
She was also maintained on Aldactone and acetazolamide ( for elevated CO2 levels ). 
The patient's lipid profile was measured during this hospitalization and she had an LDL of 64. 
She was maintained on Zocor. 
Aspirin cannot be administered due to the patient's drug allergy profile. 
From a rhythm standpoint , the patient remained in atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization through 5/18/2006. 
She was not anticoagulation , given her history of HIT and history of gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin. 
2. Pulmonary: The patient was maintained on BiPAP and Flonase throughout her hospitalization. 
Her mental status was monitored closely given her previous MICU stay during her last admission for an elevated pCO2. 
However , the patient was alert and oriented x3 during her hospitalization. 
3. Renal: The patient's creatinine was stable at approximately 1.1 during her diuresis through 10/30/2006. 
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was maintained on Nexium during her hospitalization. 
Her hematocrit remained stable at approximately 32.4. 5. Endocrinology: The patient was maintained on Levoxyl and her home NPH regimen. 
6. Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin for cellulitis on her left shin , which appeared to be improving as the erythematous area was decreasing from 5/4/206 to 10/30/2006. 
She was also started on gentamicin on 10/11/2006 for asymptomatic bacteriuria. 
The patient's urine culture on 8/19/2006 greater than 100 , 000 colonies of pseudomonas. 
CODE STATUS: During this hospitalization , the patient reiterated that she is a full code. 
It was discussed with her that she is difficult and in fact possibly and possible intubation. 
She was one time intubated nasally. 
In any event , she wants all life saving measures performed. 
At the time of this dictation , she is a full code ( healthcare proxy Debbie Hambleton , phone number ( 700 ) 752-4501 ).
