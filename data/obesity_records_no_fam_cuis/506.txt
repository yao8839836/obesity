Discharge Date: 6/3/2000 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA. 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. 
2. DIABETES MELLITUS. 
3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Pesh is a 75 year old male with a history of myocardial infarction x2 , status post CABG x3 in 1993 , who was admitted with a recent event of stable ventricular tachycardia. 
The patient's coronary risk factors include age , male gender , positive family history , history of myocardial infarction , diabetes mellitus , and hypercholesterolemia. 
The patient has no history of hypertension or tobacco use. 
The patient's history actually began in 1988 when he had chest pain and ruled in for an anteroseptal myocardial infarction. 
In 9/16 , he presented to the emergency room with wide complex tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion at the I Warho Hospital .  
During the admission in 1998 , the patient had a catheterization which revealed proximal LAD occlusion , an occluded proximal descending artery off his right coronary artery , normal hemodynamics , anteroseptal hypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , apical thrombus , and aneurysm with an EF of 50%. 
An EP study revealed 27 and 22 beat runs of nonsustained V-tach with left bundle branch block inducible after three ventricular extra stimuli during ventricular drive pacing at 400 msec. 
The ventricular tachycardia was initially suppressed with quinidine , but the patient subsequently developed nausea and vomiting , and the quinidine was switched to aconine. 
The patient did well on this regimen until 3/13 , when he developed dyspnea on exertion , no chest pain , PND , and orthopnea. 
In 1/16 , the patient had an exercise tolerance test , which she failed secondary to fatigue. 
During this ETT , his blood pressure actually fell from 125 to 85 systolic and his EKG revealed 1 mm ST depression in the limb leads. 
Therefore , on 8/5/93 , he was admitted to the I Warho Hospital and underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed 100% LAD and RCA occlusion , 60% proximal ramus stenosis , and left ventriculogram revealed anterior hypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , and apical dyskinesis with an ejection fraction of 48%. 
The decision was then made during his 1/16 admission to proceed with surgical revascularization. 
During his admission , he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft with LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and proximal descending artery , with endarterectomy to the proximal descending artery. 
The patient also underwent an EP study , and it was found that his sustained ventricular was no longer inducible either at baseline or during isoproterenol infusion. 
Since 1993 , the patient has been doing well up until the day of admission on 3/1 . 
On the day of admission , the patient developed light-headedness and palpitations while using the toilet. 
The patient denied any chest pain , dyspnea , nausea or vomiting at the time. 
EMS was notified , and the patient was found to be in V-tach. 
The patient was taken to an outside hospital and cardioverted at 100 joules after failing attempted pharmacologic conversion with Lidocaine , adenosine , and amiodarone. 
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the I Warho Hospital for further evaluation and possible placement of AICD. 
On his admission , the patient was without complaints except for some mild lower abdominal pain , which the patient attributed to his known constipation.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm since his transfer from the outside hospital. 
The patient had a catheterization , which revealed notable persistent native vessel disease with patent bypass graft x3. 
The patient was started on captopril , which was eventually increased to a dose of 25 mg t.i.d. , which he tolerated well. 
The patient had an AICD placed by the EP service with pacer leads confirmed in good position. 
The patient did experience one approximately 10 beat run of V-tach , which did not trigger the AICD to fire.
