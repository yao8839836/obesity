HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room as described above. 
He was stabilized in the PACU and transferred to the regular floor for a routine postoperative care. 
He was given an epidural for pain control as well as IV Lopressor for perioperative beta blockade while the patient was n.p.o. 
He was given supplemental oxygen and was weaned as tolerated. 
The patient was placed on the colectomy pathway postoperatively and his NG tube was removed in the morning on postoperative day #1. 
He was advanced to sips with no nausea or vomiting. 
He had a Blake drain in his pelvis and that was left initially postop until the output decreased. 
His Foley and left ureteral stent were in place for two days and then his JP drain was sent for creatinine analysis to look for a ureteral leak. 
This was found to be negative for leak and his JP drain was subsequently removed. 
The patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and he was given Ancef and Flagyl x2 two doses perioperatively as well as his home HIV meds. 
The patient initially had an uneventful postoperative course and was tolerating a house diet and had adequate ostomy output with no nausea or vomiting by postop day #3. However , by postoperative #5 , the patient's abdomen was more distended and he had increasing nausea with any type of food by mouth. 
A KUB was obtained at that time which was consistent with ileus. 
The patient was switched back to clear liquids until his ostomy began to function once again. 
He was given IV fluids for continued hydration at that time. 
By postoperative day #7 , the patient's ileus had resolved and he was passing gas and stool into his bag. 
However , the output from his bag was greater than 1200 mL per day. 
The Metamucil was added as well as Imodium to decrease the output of his ostomy. 
By postop day #7 , in addition to his high ostomy output , the patient had sinus tachycardia approximately 110 beats per minute. 
His Lopressor was increased to 20 mg q.4h. 
for increased blood pressure control , and heart rate control. 
By postoperative day #8 , his heart rate was 80s to 90s and blood pressure was 120s/70s. 
His ostomy continued to put out greater than 3 to 4 L over the course of next few days. 
During this time , the patient was tolerating a regular diet with no nausea or vomiting , but his stools were increasingly liquid and high output. 
His fluid loss was supplemented with LR in a 1:1 fashion to of avoid dehydration. 
By postoperative day #11 , the patient's ostomy continued approximately 4 L and a tincture of opium was begun as a the third line agent to decrease the ostomy output. 
This decreased ostomy output to approximately 1 L and the patient symptomatically was improving and feeling good. 
He was tolerating a regular diet with no nausea and no vomiting. 
His pain was well controlled on p.o. pain meds , and the patient stated that he would be able to keep himself well hydrated on discharge.
