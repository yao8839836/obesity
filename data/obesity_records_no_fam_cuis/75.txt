Smokes 1-2 packs per day until approximately four weeks prior to admission. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: Afebrile. 
Heart rate 66 , blood pressure 110/48 , breathing 18 , satting 98% on room air. 
Patient was noted to be in moderate distress secondary to discomfort of her right lower extremity with associated spasm and foot pain. 
Patient's lungs were noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
A well-healed right CEA scar was noted on the patient's neck. 
Patient's heart was noted to have a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Patient's abdomen was noted to be soft , nondistended and nontender. 
Extremity exam demonstrated a right leg with severe knee contracture and spasm. 
The left side was noted to be normal. 
The left foot was noted to have two small clean ulcers , one on the medial bunion and one on the tip of the medial great toe. 
The right foot was noted to have a large dark necrotic pressure wound on the lateral aspect and plantar aspect of the mid foot , an open infected-appearing ulcer was noted on the medial forefoot with surrounding erythema and a greenish exudate of film. 
Pulse exam demonstrated 2+ pulses in bilateral carotids , radials , and femorals. 
Right popliteal biphasic Doppler pulses noted. 
No pulses were able to be distinguished in the right foot. 
The left foot was noted to have biphasic signals in the DP and PT by Doppler. 
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 136 , potassium 4.8 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 74. 
ALT was 36 , AST 33 , alk phos 173 , total bili 0.3 , albumin 4.0. 
White blood cell count was 9.6 , hematocrit 36.2 , and platelets 232. 
PT 13.4 , PTT 28.1 , INR 1.0. 
Chest x-ray demonstrated a mild interstitial disease with multiple old right rib fractures. 
X-ray of the feet demonstrated bilateral osteopenia with no evidence of osteomyelitis in either foot. 
EKG was noted to be normal with a normal sinus rhythm at 63. HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service on 10/5/2004 for further evaluation and management. 
She was empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime with wet-to-dry dressings applied to her right foot wound. 
The patient was also continued on her prior dose of Macrobid for previously-diagnosed UTI with her antibiotic regimen to be discontinued for this purpose on 9/8/2004 .  
An angiogram performed on hospital day #2 , revealed a right external iliac occlusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internal and external iliac vessels. 
A distal stenosis of the external iliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. 
The patient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the access site but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards. 
Following her angiogram and percutaneous intervention , the patient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremity DP and PT pulses which remained palpable through the duration of her hospital course. 
On hospital day #3 , the patient was brought to the operating room for debridement of her right foot. 
For a detailed description of the patient's operative procedure , please the relevant operative note. 
Patient tolerated the procedure well and during the procedure , the patient's ulcer base was found to be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum , and therefore , a metatarsal head excision was performed. 
The patient's great toe was left in place with moderate debridement of the deep tissues. 
The ulcers on the lateral right foot were not debrided at this time. 
Following her procedure , the patient was empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. 
Her operative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staph which was sensitive to both Keflex and vancomycin. 
At this point , the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only and was continued on VAC therapy through postoperative day #3. 
At this point , the patient's VAC dressing was changed to demonstrate a well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulation tissue and no signs of wound necrosis. 
The patient remained in stable condition through postoperative day #7 at which point , she was returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation and definitive closure of her right foot wound. 
For a detailed description of this operative procedure , please see the relevant operative note. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently returned to the Regular Outpatient Floor where she remained for the duration of her stay. 
A general overview of the patient's hospital course by system is as follows: 1. Neurological: The patient demonstrated significant issues with pain control for the duration of her stay. 
A fair amount of her pain was determined to be secondary to her right foot ulcer; however , the patient was also noted to have significant pain associated with her contracted right lower extremity. 
For a time , the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extension brace which provided some measure of relief; however , upon regular examination of her right lower extremity , it was noted that she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary to the extension brace. 
A Neurology and Pain Service consultation was obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended for Zanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain control dramatically. 
The patient otherwise remained intact from a neurological perspective for the duration of her stay , demonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with her baseline examination. 
2. Cardiovascular: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise. 
At no point did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction. 
3. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary perspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence of acute respiratory decompensation. 
4. GI: The patient remained stable from a gastrointestinal standpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake. 
Upon discharge , she was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid p.o. intake and was noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts of stool and flatus. 
5. GU: As described previously , the patient was admitted with a known diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. 
She was continued on Macrobid therapy through 9/8/2004 , at which point this therapy was discontinued. 
Subsequent follow-up urinalyses demonstrated no further evidence of urinary tract infection. 
Upon completion of her Macrobid antibiotic course , the patient's Foley catheter was removed and she was noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of her stay. 
She at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renal compromise or electrolyte imbalance. 
6. Heme: The patient remained stable with a stable hematocrit for the duration of her stay. 
She was started on Plavix therapy following her angiogram , on which she remains at the time of her discharge. 
DVT prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparin for the duration of her stay. 
7. ID: As stated above , the patient's operative cultures were noted to grow coag.-negative staph , sensitive to both vancomycin and Keflex. 
For the majority of her stay , the patient remained on vancomycin therapy but was transitioned to Keflex on 1/11/2004 , on which she remained for the duration of her stay. 
At the time of discharge , the patient has been instructed to complete an additional 10-day course of Keflex therapy. 
Of note , the patient remained afebrile with a stable white count for the duration of her stay and her wound exam demonstrated no evidence of further infection at the ulcer site. 
8. Endocrine: The patient maintained adequately well-controlled blood sugars for the duration of her stay with no evidence of acute endocrinological compromise. 
The patient was subsequently cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on postoperative days 10 and 3 , 7/11/2004 , with instructions for follow up. 
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Patient is to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility with instructions for follow up.
