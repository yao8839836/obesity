Renal: No issues. 
Endocrine: No issues. 
Hematology: Anticoagulated with aspirin and Coumadin. 
Recent mitral valve repair/atrial fib. 
ID: No issues. 
Of note , recent video swallow , the patient needs Dobbhoff tubes for meds p.o. until Nutrition gives further Rx. On the Step-Down Unit , starting postop day #3 , no narcotics. 
An 88-year-old status post circ arrest confused , impulsive and on sitter , Pacing wire remains in place. 
On postop day #4 , rate controlled A fib , hypertensive , added low-dose captopril to Lopressor 12.5 q.i.d. , diuresing well , remains on 1.5 L O2 , strict n.p.o. for aspiration per Speech and Swallow. 
On tube feeds via Dobbhoff , confusion improving , no narcotics/sedatives. 
UA sent for MS changes , negative for UTI. 
Wires discontinued. 
Coumadin for A fib. Rehabilitation screening initiated. 
On postop day #5 , rate controlled A fib , Coumadin. 
BP still hypertensive , increased captopril to 12.5 t.i.d. 
Ambulating with PT on room air. 
Dobbhoff in place. 
All meds/nutrition via Dobbhoff. 
Postop echo ordered for MVP. 
Off sitters today , clear mental status. 
No narcotics/sedatives. 
UA clean. 
On postop day #6 , rate controlled A fib. BP improved on captopril. 
Cards following , recommending to preferentially increase Lopressor and decrease captopril as tolerated. 
Of note , the patient has been quite hypertensive this week with heart rate well controlled even low-dose Lopressor. 
Increased Lopressor to 25 mg q.i.d. , captopril 12.5 t.i.d. 
Creatinine 0.4 , has diuresed well. 
Postop echo with an EF of 45% to 50% , moderate LVH , hypokinetic anterior septal and inferior wall , normal RV. Severe LAE and RAE , paravalvular leak seen at AVR with mild AI , trace MR , mild TR. Also has large left pleural effusion , was seen on echo. 
Only small bilateral effusions were seen on chest x-ray. 
The patient's main issue now is PT and Speech and Swallow reassessment. 
Dobbhoff was repositioned today for tube in stomach with tip newly pointing upwards into the esophagus. 
Post-repositioning KUB shows tip now downwards in stomach. 
Given some Reglan to advance. 
Clear mental status. 
Junky cough cannot produce sputum for sample.

No heparin for now per Dr. Verda Triarsi On postop day #9 , tube feeds off at midnight , getting repeat video swallow on a.m. for speech and swallow. 
Holding Coumadin , which was given for chronic A fib pending possible PEG placement. 
On postop day #10 , A fib/room air. 
Video swallow study showed improvement , but patient still silently aspirating. 
Speech and swallow recommends PEG and continued work with Speech and Swallow for eventual goal of patient taking p.o.'s. 
Contacted Metabolic Support. 
They will send someone to evaluate the patient for PEG , so the procedure will likely take place on Wednesday or Thursday. 
On postop day #11 , A fib/room air , feeding tubes were part way out , readvanced and got KUB showing good placement. 
Metabolic support evaluated the patient , got consent for PEG. 
On postop day #12 , A fib/room air , holding tube feeds and Coumadin for PEG placement , scheduled for 10 a.m. 
Thursday. 
No heparin per Dr. Denmark May go to rehab once INR therapeutic for A fib. 
The patient had a four-beat run of VT. On postop day #13 , he was supposed to have PEG placed today. 
Metabolic support said that someone called the OR desk yesterday and canceled the procedure , so it was rescheduled for Tuesday due to no OR availability. 
Otherwise , the patient was supposed to have repeat video swallow next week. 
Hemodynamically stable. 
Holding Coumadin. 
Rehabilitation when ready. 
On postop day #14 , PEG tube placement rescheduled for next Tuesday , giving low-dose Coumadin for A fib , at goal tube feeds through Dobhoff , hemodynamically stable. 
On postop day #15 , doing well. 
General surgery consult called to try and get PEG placed earlier the next Tuesday. 
Dr. Verda Triarsi will do it either tomorrow or Monday at the latest. 
Otherwise , doing well , n.p.o. after midnight. 
Hopefully , he will get PEG and can go to rehabilitation. 
On postop day #16 , tube feeding restarted. 
PEG placement tomorrow. 
Otherwise , doing well , rate controlled A fib. Rehabilitation once PEG tube placed. 
On postop day #17 , finally received peg today , currently on D5 in a half at 50 mL an hour , okay to give meds through PEG and can restart tube feeds tomorrow. 
NG tube out. 
Coumadin to restart tonight.
