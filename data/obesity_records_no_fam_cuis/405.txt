At baseline can walk 4-5 blocks , over last couple weeks can only walk about 1 block before becoming SOB. 
Was also getting SOB w/ minimal activity at home including showering. 
Sleeps on one pillow , no orthopnea , no PND. 
Has had some pedal edema over the few weeks. 
Increased urination and increased thirst , no reported change in diet. 
Recently stopped HCTZ but no other change in meds. 
Also w/ some dull chest pain over left side that radiates in a band like fashion across his stenum to back , 3-4/10 in intensity , not brought on by activity , lasts for seconds at a time when present , pleuritic. 
Reproducible w/ palpation. 
Pt had fallen on his right side several weeks earlier. 
Some dull abdominal discomfort in lower quadrants usually improved with bowel movements , last BM yesterday. 
No n/v. 
No calf tenderness , no recent surgery , no recent travel. 
March wt 158lbs by records , pt has not noticed any weight gain. 
Pt reports not having this pain previously , however by records pt was evaluated in 3/2/05 for similar atypical chest pains that was ultimately a neg workup , with ECHO 4/9 w/ diastolic dysfn EF 60-65% , no WMA , mod MR , mod TR , stress test 8/13 w/ no changes c/w ischemia on EKG or ECHO ( but non-diagnositic due to peak HR 64 BP 140/66 ). 
He was seen by Dr Holtzberg at that time who felt that ACS/ischemia was unlikely , and that symptoms may have been 2/2 CHF and MR ( and his ECHO also showed new AI at that time ) , and pt was apparently started on ACE at that time for afterload reduction. 
He is not on an ACE right now and it is unclear why. 
Further w/u of ischemia was suggested if the pt had persistent symptoms but the symptoms seemed to have resolved by these notes.

Suspect CHF as cause of increasing SOB. 
Suspicion for ACS low given previous neg w/u w/ similar atypical chest pain presentation , at that time also thought to be 2/2 CHF. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: --CV: I: h/o CAD s/p CABG , but suspicion for ischemia low. 
Ruled out by enzymes and EKG x 3. Suspect elevated troponin 2/2 demand ischemia from CHF. 
On ASA , BB. Not on statin , but lipid panel in 10/25 w/ LDL 87 and total chol 166. 
Started on low dose ACE lisinopril 5mg. 
MIBI no reversible changes. 
P: CHF , goal dry weight 158 lbs , admission weight 164 lbs. 
On Lasix 60mg daily at home. 
Diuresed , responded well to IV Lasix 60mg , w/ improvement in SOB and clinical exam , dc weight 160.5lbs. 
Will send out on 60mg BID x 1 week and then back to 60mg daily. 
Concern that worsening MR may be constributing to CHF and possibly flash in setting of htn , but ECHO showed mid/mod MR not changed from 4/9 .  
Also w/ trace AI , mild/mod TR , diastolic dysfunction w/ restrictive defect , EF 65% , no WMA , PAP 58+RAP ( which has preogressive increased from previous ECHO reports , was 41 in 4/9 ) , likely cor pulmonale from left sided heart failure. 
MIBI did not show any reversible ishcemia. 
Was on labetalol and norvasc for htn and BPs suboptimal in 160s -180s , previously on captopril 37.5 TID but stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. 
started on low dose lisinopril 5mg daily for afterload reduction especially in setting of MR , will need to f/u K closely. 
Pt tolerated 2 doses captopril ( 25 and 37.5 ) without hyperkalemia in hospital but on higher doses of lasix. 
Imdur 30mg daily also added. 
Pt also on clonidine. 
R: on tele , sinus brady , asymptomatic , no other events. 
--RESP: satting fine on room air with resolution of SOB after diuresis. 
--GI: constipation , cont colace and senna. 
On pepcid given on prednisone. 
--RENAL: ESRD s/p transplant 11/1 .  
cont tacrolimus , cellcept , prednisone. 
Tacrolimus levels nl. 
Followed by renal transplant team who agreed w/ management of BPs above. 
--HEME: anemia , Hct stable. 
--ENDO: diabetes. 
Continued initially on home nph regimen w/ novolog sliding scale. 
Pt became hypoglycemic overnight both nights to the 40s and to less than 20s ( the latter in the setting of not eating dinner ) , both around 3-4am. 
Pt says that in the morning he is sometimes low and sometimes high in 100s. 
Suspect this may be happening chronically w/ possible rebound hyperglycemia in AM Will be sent home on decreased NPH regimen at night 8U , resume AM dose 24U. 
--FEN: 2L fluid restriction , low sodium/chol/fat/diabetic diet --PPx: heparin , pepcid FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: We have changed the following medications: 1 NPH 24U in the morning and 8U in the evening , as your overnight sugars have been low 2. Take Lasix 60mg twice a day for one week and then go back to one time a day on 5/23 3. lisinopril and imdur have been added to help control your blood pressure. 
Please drink only 2L fluids daily and keep daily weights. 
Your weight goal is 158 lbs , if your weight is over this or increases by more than 2-3 lbs , call Dr. Hazinski .
