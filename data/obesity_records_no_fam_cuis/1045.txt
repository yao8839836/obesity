HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient was admitted March , 1996 with a history of one to two months of stable exertional angina which became crescendo angina and an exercise stress test , thallium , revealed multivessel disease. 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery bypass grafting on March , 1996 , right carotid endarterectomy on March , 1996 , he had some post-operative atrial fibrillation/flutter as above , he was status post a myocardial infarction , he had a history of hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes times three years , and gout. 
ALLERGIES: He had no known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: Included an eight pack year tobacco history which he quit approximately thirty years ago and he drank alcohol socially. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a well-developed , well-nourished white man in no apparent distress. 
On transfer to Medicine , his vital signs were a temperature of 98.8 , heart rate of 140 in atrial flutter , blood pressure 150/70 , and breathing at 18 with a room air saturation of 94%. 
HEENT: Examination showed his extraocular muscles intact , pupils equal , round , and reactive to light , his right carotid endarterectomy had Steri-Strips , his left carotid pulse was 2+ without bruit , he had no lymphadenopathy , and his oropharynx was benign. 
LUNGS: Clear bilaterally. 
CARDIAC: Examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm and he was tachycardic without a murmur. 
ABDOMEN: Examination showed that bowel sounds were present and it was benign. 
EXTREMITIES: Examination showed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , posterior tibial pulses were 2+/2+ , and his dorsalis pedis pulses were trace bilaterally. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Examination showed that he was alert and oriented times three and grossly non-focal. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant for a normal SMA 7 , CBC which had a white count of 3.7 , a hematocrit of 33.8 with 407 platelets , a sedimentation rate was 48 , his digoxin level on transfer was 1.3 , his procainamide level was 2.6 , and his NAPA was 1.1 on transfer. 
An EKG showed atrial flutter at 140. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: He underwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1996 which revealed a left dominant system with left anterior descending with serial 60% complex lesions , mid left anterior descending 70% lesion , and a ramus 40% lesion. 
The left circumflex was totally occluded proximally and the right coronary artery was small with an 80% mid vessel stenosis. 
Left ventriculogram revealed normal systolic function. 
On November , 1996 , he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery with a LIMA to his left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to his OM1 , and a saphenous vein graft to his OM2. 
On May , 1996 , he developed atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 180 range , blood pressure 160/90 , he complained of palpitations , and was diaphoretic. 
He received Lopressor 5 mg intravenously times two , his blood pressure responded with decrease to 120/72 , and his heart rate remained in the 140 range with atrial fibrillation. 
He converted to normal sinus rhythm in the eighties. 
He was loaded with Digoxin and maintained on Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
That evening , he had a second episode of atrial fibrillation. 
On March , 1996 , he underwent right carotid endarterectomy for an asymptomatic 90% stenosis. 
In the PACU , he had atrial fibrillation in the 150 range with decreased blood pressure to the seventies. 
On March , 1996 , he had another episode of atrial fibrillation lasting approximately thirty minutes which converted to normal sinus rhythm with 5 mg of Lopressor. 
On January , 1996 , he converted into atrial fibrillation at approximately 4 a.m. and his blood pressure was 160/100 , his heart rate was approximately in the 130 range , and carotid sinus pressure produced no change in his rate. 
An ECG revealed a supraventricular tachycardia at 130 beats per minute , likely atrial flutter , with 2:1 conduction. 
Verapamil 5 mg q.5 minutes times two intravenously resulted in a heart rate drop from 120 to 70 which revealed atrial flutter. 
At this point , he was transferred to Medicine for further management. 
His medications on transfer included magnesium and potassium sliding scale , Axid 150 p.o. b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet one to two tablets p.r.n. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Benadryl p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Procan SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. started on March , 1996 , and Metamucil p.r.n. 
Post-transfer , he was maintained on his cardiac regimen overnight. 
He remained in atrial flutter throughout the night , was slight diaphoretic but had no other associated symptoms. 
He was cardioverted electrically on November , 1996 into normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the seventies to nineties. 
DISPOSITION: He is discharged on September , 1996 after cardioversion in stable condition. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Percocet one to two tablets q.3-4h. 
p.r.n. , Procan SR 750 mg p.o. q.i.d. , and Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 
FOLLOW-UP: He has follow-up appointments with Dr. Myerscough Dictated By: FLO VERSIE TITTERNESS , M.D. JT55 Attending: CHRISTINE DARIO , M.D. AW87 WS783/3101 Batch: 98826 Index No. DEAJVF1DVX D: 1/12/96 T: 3/7/96
