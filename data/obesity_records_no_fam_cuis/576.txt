Discharge Date: 8/8/1995 DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE: 1. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. 
2. HYPERTENSION. 
3. NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS. 
4. PNEUMONIA HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year old woman with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation who was admitted with fever , rapid atrial fibrillation , shortness of breath , and chest pain. 
She has had atrial fibrillation for one and a half years and she had been rate controlled with Digoxin , Lopressor , and Diltiazem in the past. 
She had been poorly compliant with her medications. 
In 9/19 , she had a MIBI which was negative for reversible perfusion defect and in 6/10 , she had an echo that showed normal left ventricular size and left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 to 55% with a large left atrium. 
She had moderate distal hypokinesis and trace tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. 
In 7/13 , she had a Holter that showed atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter at a rate of 70 to 185. 
In 4/3 , she was admitted to Pagham University Of with substernal chest pain and increasing shortness of breath. 
A chest X-Ray at this time showed pulmonary edema. 
She was treated with intravenous Lopressor and Lasix and ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
One day prior to admission , the patient noted the onset of increasing shortness of breath and wheezing. 
She had a cough productive of yellow sputum. 
She was seen in the Emergency Room and at that time , was afebrile with an O2 saturation of 93% on room air. 
She was in atrial fibrillation at 100 and her laboratories were within normal limits. 
She was discharged to home. 
She returned to the Emergency Ward several hours later with persistent shortness of breath now complaining of substernal chest pain. 
She did have a temperature of 101 at this point and she was admitted for further evaluation. 
She was given Lasix 20 mg intravenously in the Emergency Room. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1 ) Chronic atrial fibrillation. 
2 ) Hypertension. 3 ) Non-Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
4 ) Diverticulitis status post sigmoid colectomy. 
5 ) Status post ventral hernia repair. 
6 ) Status post right carpal-tunnel release. 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 2.5 mg , Restoril p.r.n. , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Digoxin. 
She does not smoke or drink any alcohol. 
ALLERGIES: She is allergic to Penicillin. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a Hispanic woman in no apparent distress. 
Her temperature was 101.6 , blood pressure 122/70 , heart rate 110 , she was saturating 99% on two liters. 
HEENT: Examination was within normal limits. 
NECK: Supple with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention. 
CHEST: Showed diffuse expiratory wheezes with crackles at the left base. 
CARDIAC: Examination showed an S1 and S2 with an irregular heartbeat , there were no murmurs , and her carotids were 2+ without bruits. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , and non-distended. 
EXTREMITIES: Showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was within normal limits. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest X-Ray showed pulmonary edema with question of an infiltrate at the left base in addition. 
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 111 and she had no T wave or ST segment changes. 
Her SMA 7 was within normal limits , her white blood cell count was 8.7 , her hematocrit was 42 , her platelets were 201 , her liver function tests were within normal limits , her INR on admission was 1.7 , and her digoxin level was 0.4. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for possible pneumonia and rule out myocardial infarction as well as congestive heart failure. 
She was started on Cefotaxime intravenously and put on nebulized inhalers. 
All cultures , blood and sputum cultures , were negative and her chest X-Ray the next day was clear suggesting that the patient most likely had a tracheobronchitis rather than an actual pneumonia. 
From a cardiac standpoint , she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction protocol. 
She ruled out , she was given increased diuresis , and her rales and wheezes improved. 
Over the next several days , she did well , however , she did have still some evidence of congestive heart failure on examination. 
An echo was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 50 to 55% with normal left ventricular size. 
The patient was therefore changed from Digoxin to Diltiazem 60 t.i.d. for her rate control for atrial fibrillation. 
Her Lasix dose was also increased to 40 mg p.o. q.d. 
The Atenolol was discontinued. 
The patient did very well on this regimen. 
She had no further evidence of rales or wheezing and her congestive heart failure seemed to be in much better control. 
Her heart rate was well controlled on the Diltiazem at a rate of 60 to 70 with blood pressures of 120/70. 
Her initial complaints of cough also resolved. 
She was changed to p.o. antibiotics and was sent home to complete a ten day course for presumed pneumonia. 
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged in good condition on 7/18/95 . 
She is to follow-up with Dr. Noblin , her primary medical doctor , on Monday , 4/13/95 at his walk-in clinic.
