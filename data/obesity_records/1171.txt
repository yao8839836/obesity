BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI:
66F with obesity , HTN , DM , aortic stenosis and history of abnormal LFTs
evaluated Dr. Germaine Blackgoat , for which differential has included NASH ,
hypothyroidism , drug ( avandia? , less likely ACE or lipitor ). She
underwent an U/S guided liver bx 6/26 performed by IR. After the
procedure , she had documented hypotension with a presyncopal episode.
Immediate CT showed hematoma around her R and L liver lobes and some
peritoneal blood superior to spleen but noretroperitoneal blood. She was
sent to the ED for evaluation. Her BP normalized with NS , and she was
never tachycardic. Serial hematocrtis were 35.1 , 32.8 and 29.8. She
was not transfused. A repeat CT showed stable hematoma with
peripancreatitc stranding , and she was admitted for further observation.
After the procedure she complained of RUQ and periumbilical pain. She
currently denies pain and expresses interest in eating. Denies N/V.

HOSP COURSE:
The patient has had elevated LFTs of unknown etiology and had a liver
biopsy on 6/26 after which she developed a liver hematoma by CT with Hct
drop from 35 to 29.8 ( in the context of hydration for a pre-syncope
episode ). Repeat CT showed the hematoma was stable but also showed some
peri-pancreatic fat stranding somewhat concerning for pancreatitis by
needle aggravation ( since not significant amounts of blood were observed in
the retroperitoneal area ). Lipase and amylase were slightly elevated at 85
and 74 respectively , but she had no symtpoms of abd pain , nausea , vomiting.
Recheck of lipase and amylase within 12 hours showed stable or improved
values of 69 and 74 respectively. Her Hct was stable at 31.5 upon recheck.
She had peristent absence of abdominal pain and tolerated a full diet
without complications. Her anti-hypertensive meds ( HCTZ and ACE ) were
held due to SBPs in the 100s and should be continued as outpatient as
necessary per followup with PCP Prince Raugust Her ASA was also held and
should be restarted per Dr. Cranford as outpt.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Follow up apt with Germaine Blackgoat to get results of liver biopsy
2. Follow up apt with PCP Julian Cranford for restarting BP meds and ASA
3. Return to ED if you have any abdominal pain or rpt sx of
light-headedness , racing heart , SOB , sweating
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
