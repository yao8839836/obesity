HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit after his first operation on 2/3/2004 which was revision
left total hip arthroplasty. It went without complications but
because of his pulmonary hypertension and need for a central line
monitoring he was admitted for the ICU. He did quite well in the
ICU and was discharged the next day to the floor. On the floor
he received pain control , antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours and
was started on Lovenox right away in anticipation of surgery next
week for his right total hip. He mobilized his physical therapy
and did well. There were no signs of infection over the course
of the week or DVT. One week later he went on to a right total
hip replacement which also went without complications but did not
require an ICU stay. Again , he was given antibiotics
perioperatively for 48 hours. His was started on Coumadin the
night of the surgery to maintain an INR of 2-3 for 14 days with
Lovenox which he was given right away and then to maintain an INR
of 3-4 after the initial 14 days postoperatively. He did well
with physical therapy , was getting out of bed. His incisions
were clean , dry and intact bilaterally. The remainder of his
postop course was uncomplicated.
PLAN:
1. INR of 2-3 with Lovenox 40 mg b.i.d. for the first 14 days
