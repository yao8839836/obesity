BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
This 64 year-old right-handed woman presented after being found down and
weak on the left. She has a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung
cancer and has been receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy
treatments. She presented outside the window for thrombolysis or
intervention. Exam revealed plegia of the left face and arm , paresis of
the left leg , and an incomplete neglect syndrome. MRI/MRA revealed
partial right MCA territory stroke and suggested severe proximal right
ICA stenosis; she was placed on heparin. Antihypertensives , aside from
low-dose metoprolol , were held. CT/CTA head and neck the following day
confirmed a severe proximal right ICA stenosis and revealed evolution of
the stroke to involve much of the right MCA territory. The heparin was
discontinued and the patient placed back on clopidogrel. The Grismi Boisran Hospital
under Dr. Attkisson evaluated the patient and recommended a follow-up
appointment with him two weeks after discharge.
Laboratory work-up pertinent to stroke revealed a normal homocysteine ,
normal TSH , lipid profile with LDL 108 , HDL 52 , TG 131 , and Lp( a )
lipoprotein elevated at 93. She was continued on a statin , and low-dose
niacin added to the regimen because of the Lp( a ) results. Her hemoglobin
A1c and random blood sugars were elevated; she received an insulin
sliding scale. Echocardiogram showed normal LVEF and size , no wall motion
abnormalities , + evidence of diastolic dysfunction , and normal LA size.
Her cell counts trended downward in an expected fashion given the timing
of her most recent chemotherapy. She was placed on neutropenic
precautions. Her oncologist Dr. Enamorado recommended administering
prophylactic ciprofloxacin and a single dose of long-acting G-CSF. She is
not planned to receive any additional chemotherapeutic or radiation
therapy treatments in the near future.
Her neurological examination remained stable. Repeat head CTs done to
assess for edema following the stroke revealed some effacement of the
right lateral ventricle , but no threatening mass effect.
Her serum sodium trended down throughout admission; it is recommended
that she not receive hypotonic fluids at rehab and that she be water
restricted to 1L per day , and take salt as directed.
Given her thrombocytopenia , it is recommended that antiplatelet therapy
with clopidogrel be held until her platelet count rises over 100. It is
also recommended that anticoagulation with therapeutic low-molecular
weight heparin as bridge to warfarin with target INR 2-3 be restarted 2
weeks after her stroke , on 2/16/05. She should follow up for
neurological issues with Dr. Attkisson of neurosurgery as well as her
outpatient neurologist , Dr. Rossie Mankoski , at Tonsta Ean Villebaxt Hospital
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
1. hold clopidogrel until plt &gt; 100k
2. start low-molecular weight heparin as a bridge to warfarin ( target INR
2-3 ) and discontinue clopidogrel 7/1/05
3. Free water restrict 1L per day , follow serum sodium.
4. Follow up with Dr. Attkisson in 2 weeks.
