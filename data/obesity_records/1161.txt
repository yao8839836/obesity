Discharge Date: 11/25/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SUPERFICIAL THROMBOPHLEBITIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: SLEEP APNEA , HISTORY OF RECURRENT
DVT'S , GERD.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Sturghill is a 50 year old woman
followed by Dr. Devin Brady in KTDUOO Clinic
with a history of recurrent DVTs who presented with pleuritic chest
pain and left lower extremity calf pain. She had a DVT about 10
years ago in the left lower extremity. She was coumadinized at that
time for 3 months. In September of 1994 she had an abdominal hernia
repair and had recurrent DVT by LENIs but was not treated. On 8/5
she presented again with a left lower extremity pain and was found
to have an acute and chronic deep venous thrombosis and was
anticoagulated with Heparin and changed to Coumadin at home. The
patient was poorly compliant with her Coumadin. In October of 1995
she was too depressed to take her Coumadin. Her INR dropped. She
had sharp chest pain like gas over her precordium. The pain cleared
spontaneously. Eventually she called her KTDUOO primary doctor , Dr.
Brady complaining of this pain and was admitted to the I Warho Hospital for rule out MI and rule out PE. VQ scan at that
time was low probability. She was discharged on Coumadin 5mg a day
and Lasix 20mg a day for lower extremity edema. A dobutamine MIBI
was also performed and was negative. On 1/10 she came to the EW
complaining of chest pressure and left lower extremity swelling.
She reported that since 7/25 she started having right anterior
chest pain with chest wall pain which was increased with deep
ventilation , no cough. She did have some increased shortness of
breath and she reported increased swelling and pain of the left
lower extremity and overall was feeling poorly.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is as above and also includes obesity and
osteoarthritis of the knees.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Lasix , Zoloft.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was obese black female. Temperature 98.1 ,
heart rate 72 , blood pressure 138/80.
Respiration is 20. 02 saturation on 4 liters was 96%. HEENT:
Unremarkable other than obesity and a sick sounding voice. Chest:
Clear to auscultation. Cardiac Exam: Regular rate and rhythm with a
II/VI systolic murmur over the left sternal border , no S3 , no S4.
Abdomen: Obese , soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Left lower extremity
was tender in the calf but not warm , no erythematous. She did have
trace edema. Her pulses distally were 2+ on both sides.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable for a hematocrit of 47 , a white
count of 5.2 , platelets of 236 , normal
SMA7 , a PT of 13.9 and INR of 1.3 , a PTT of 31.5. Chest x-ray
showed no acute infiltrate. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at
78 with an axis of 58 , normal intervals , Q in III , and F in I ,
upright Ts in III , no RVH , no strain compared with prior EKGs. ABG
on room air was pH of 7.39 , PC02 of 47 and P02 of 57 , 88%
saturation. LENIs showed no right DVT , a left greater saphenous
vein superficial venous thrombosis , no change compared with 10/16/95.
A VQ scan was low probability and when compared to the study of
October 1995 was entirely unchanged.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , heparinized and begun on
Coumadin with a goal PTT of 60-80 and INR of 2-3.
Her calf pain was felt secondary to superficial thrombophlebitis
and post phlebitic syndrome. Interventional Radiology was consulted
to obtain a PA gram , however they felt that the risk of the
procedure outweighed the benefits given that her VQ scan was
entirely unchanged from prior. Her hypoxia seemed related more to
her sleep apnea. She was started on CPAP , which she tolerated
rather poorly , however was encouraged to continue to use it given
her potential long-term benefits. She had an 02 saturation on room
air in the high 80s to low 90s , which improved when she used the
CPAP. There was an initial thought that there may be cellulitis in
the left lower extremity , however this was born out clinically and
she was initially started on I.V. oxacillin in the Emergency Room
but this was stopped after one day. Of note , her chest pain seemed
to be quite esophageal or reflux related and she was started on
Axid with remarkable decrease in her symptoms. Sputum culture was
obtained and showed oral flora. She had no infiltrate on chest
x-ray and was not treated for bronchitis either.
DISPOSITION: She was therefore discharged in stable condition to
follow up with Dr. Brady in Clinic as well as the Sleep
Study Lab recommended that she follow up with ENT to see if any
surgical options were available to her in correcting her sleep
apnea. MEDICATIONS: Lasix 20mg p.o. q day , Coumadin 5mg p.o.
q.h.s. , Zoloft 50mg p.o. q day , Axid 150mg p.o. b.i.d. She will
follow up with Dr. Devin Brady in Clinic and in the ENT Clinic 1-2
weeks after discharge. She will also follow up in Coumadin Clinic
two days after discharge to have her INR checked in KTDUOO .
