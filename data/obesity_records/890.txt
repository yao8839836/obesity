resolved spontaneously. Came to ED , EKG was paced , CK flat , TnI
elevated at 0.17 , similar to value on 4/21 when pt came in for a TIA.
Mr. Brofft was sent home with sl nitro. Pain occurred again while
watching TV , resolved with one sl nitro. Was admitted for workup of
possible ischemia. Currently CP free.
1. CV: Ischemia: ruled out for MI , added isordil to regimen , ASA.
Continue carvedilol , captopril. Likely to have CAD , Adenosine MIBI
revealed fixed inf/lat defect , consistent with LCX disease. No
reversible defects. Since chest pain is unlikely to be cardiac in
origin , will stop nitrates. Pt was able to amubulate w/o SOB or CP
