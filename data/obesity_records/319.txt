ATTENDING: ABSHEAR , CARLTON MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
An 86-year-old female with diabetes , end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , coronary artery disease , hypertension , history of
recent CVA , presents with hypotension and shock , question of
sepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient , as mentioned above an 86-year-old with history of
end-stage renal disease , insulin dependent diabetes , CAD status
post MI , bilateral above the knee amputations secondary to
peripheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular accident in 10/18 ,
who was initially admitted on 10/26/05 for nausea , vomiting , and
diaphoresis. Previously , the patient was admitted to P Therford Hospital
for vertigo that was consistent with a right pontine lacunar
infarct , but despite being on Plavix and aspirin that was in
10/18 .  Her hospital course was complicated by an MI , and the
patient was medically managed. The patient was again admitted to
the P Therford Hospital on 5/18/05 for hypotension and unresponsiveness
after dialysis. She had negative CT at that point. Since that
admission , she had been doing well until 10/26/05 when she had
nausea vomiting and diaphoresis following hemodialysis. She was
admitted to rule out cardiac cause versus infection. Her
hospital course was complicated by continued hypotension and
decreased temperature. In the emergency department , on
presentation , the patient had a temperature of 95.8 , heart rate
of 102. Her blood pressure was 83 to 122 over 40s to 60s. Her
respiratory rate was 16. She was sating 95% on room air. She
got 500 mg of levofloxacin and her Lopressor was held due to
hypotension , and she was admitted with concern for infectious
process. She was initially admitted to the floor where she was
found to be afebrile with the rate of 92 , respirations of 20 , and
blood pressure was 100/57. Her exam revealed bibasilar rales ,
left greater than the right. Her abdominal exam revealed
nontender and nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
Her extremities revealed warm. She had bilateral below the knee
amputations. Her cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate and
rhythm with the 2/6 systolic murmur.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for chronic renal insufficiency , end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis , insulin-dependent diabetes , CVA ,
bilateral below the knee amputations , CAD , status post MI in
10/18 , hypertension , and peripheral vascular disease.
MEDICATIONS:
Folate 1 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , NPH , Isordil , lisinopril ,
Plavix 75 mg , Paxil 10 mg , Pravachol 20 mg , Neurontin , Protonix
40 mg , vitamin B12 100 mcg , and Nephrocaps.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She lives with her grandchildren. She does not smoke or drink.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Significant for sister with coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Neurologic exam: She is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY DATA:
Significant for CK of 39 , MB of 2.3 , and troponin of 0.36. Her
white count was 8. Her hematocrit was 36.2 , and her platelets
were 298 , 000. Her INR was 1.3. Her EKG revealed a regular rate
and rhythm. Normal axis. T-wave inversions and flattenings in
the lateral leads on low voltage in the limb leads. Her chest
x-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation and left effusion.
IMPRESSION:
An 86-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , presenting with episodes of nausea , vomiting , and
diaphoresis of unclear etiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient had a slight
troponin leak. It was unclear for initial presenting symptoms or
subsequent secondary to ischemia. On her second hospital day ,
she developed hypotension. Initially , her systolic blood
pressure dropped to the 80s and her blood pressure medicines were
held. Subsequently , her blood pressure dropped into the 70s and
she required dopamine and was transferred to the Cardiac Care
Unit. In the Cardiac Care Unit , she was started on the dopamine
drip of 10 mcg/kg/minute. In the Cardiac Care Unit , the initial
differential diagnoses were hypertension was cardiogenic versus
septic physiology. However , her white count revealed significant
elevation of 24.6 with bandemia , 10% bands. She also had an
elevated lactate of 9.3 concerning for GI etiology. Possibly gut
ischemia was the cause of her infection. She was covered broadly
with amp , vanc , levo , and Flagyl. She subsequently required the
addition of Neo-Synephrine as a second pressor agent to maintain
her blood pressure. Dopamine was weaned off. However , on the
second day in the CCU , on 9/26/05 , the patient developed sudden
hypotension. Physicians were called to see the patient and at
that time she was found to have no palpable pulse. Code was
initiated. The patient was found to be in pulseless electrical
activity. Chest compressions were initiated , and she was mask
ventilated , and she received multiple rounds of epinephrine and
atropine. She received 2 amps of bicarbonate and 1 amp of
calcium gluconate given concern for hyperkalemia in the setting
of end-stage renal disease. Anesthesia then arrived and the
patient was intubated. Despite all efforts , the patient's rhythm
deteriorated to asystole , and she was pronounced dead at 5:30
p.m. on 9/26/05 , which was the time of death.
