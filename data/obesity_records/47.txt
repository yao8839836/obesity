BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Admitted from office 10/26/01 for infected L THR. Aspiration
demonstrated purulent material. Started on Ceftriaxone per ID consult
recs. MIC to both PCN and Ceftriaxone pending. MRI of pelvis completed
6/27/01 as pre-op eval. TU Cardiology was consulted for pre-op
clearance given extensive H/O cardiomyopathy and unstentable CAD per
last cardiac cath 3/5 .  On further d/w PT , he was adament about being
allowed to be D/C home on Abx for July holiday. Given that his
clinical picture was much improved on antibiotics , both Dr Beliz and ID
MD agreed to this on provision that he return immediately for any
evidence of progressing infection. His R hip pain and exam were much
improved by time of discharge. Will plan for IV lon line to be placed
prior to D/C for home dosing of QD Ceftriaxone. ID to be re-consulted
on admission post-op 1/2 for re-eval of abx choice. By that time it
is presumed that the MIC for PCN/CTX will be available for ascertation
of proper long-term Abx care.
