BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
59 year-old right-handed woman admitted for suspected acute stroke. Her
PMH includes HTN , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA vs. stroke 10/26
( manifest as slurred speech , left arm and leg weakness ). prior
myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , and history of left Bell's palsy x 3 with
chronic weakness of facial expression muscles on the left. She had a
possible patent foramen ovale with agitated saline contrast passage on
valsalva maneuver TTE when she was admitted 11/25 for stroke work-up.
Recently , this woman has had 2-weeks of general fatigue , exertional dys
pnea , frequent headaches , and intermittent blurred vision while driving
followed by a 2-3 second episode of binocular visual loss 4/13/03.
Notably , she ran out of amlodipine and reports obtaining a level of
240/150 on self-monitoring. One day prior to admission she saw her PCP
who noted hypertension and referred her to an ophthalmologist , who
obtained a normal exam by report.
She awoke this morning with a more severe right frontal headache with
pain radiating to the right shoulder. She also experienced a problem
with gait , leaning to the right. Her husband phoned EMS because she had
a severe headache and seemed "confused." At present , the patient denies
headache and confusion , as well as diplopia , vertigo , dysphagia , and
dysarthria. She denies recent chest pain , but has had orthopnea.
PMHx: hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA versus stroke ,
prior myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent
left Bell's palsy , allergic rhinitis , chronic renal insufficiency
( baseline creatinine around 1.5 )
Meds: ASA 81 , HCTZ , atenolol , amlodipine , atorvastatin , loratadine , PRN
albuterol
All: iodinated contrast , losartan
VS: T 97.2 HR 57 BP 150/90
GEN obese woman , comfortable HEENT sclerae anicteric , oral mucosa moist
NECK: no bruits
HEART mild bradycardia , regular rhythm , II/VI SEM at USB ABD soft ,
nontender , nondistended EXT: no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema; radial
and dorsalis pedis pulses 2+
NEURO: MS significant for no deficits on orientation , attention , langua
ge , memory , and praxis. CN exam significant for right hypertropic skew ,
left facial droop , mostly lower face but with weak eyebrow raise as
well. Motor exam with normal tone , no pronator drift , strength 5/5 in
all muscle groups in upper and lower extremities. Coordination exam
with slightly slowed fine finger movements , right hand , normal
performance on finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin , sensory exam
without deficits in light touch , temperature , vibratory sensation ,
reflexes 2 throughout except for 1 in the ankles , toes downgoing
bilaterally. GAIT slightly wided based but stable gait with upright
posture , normal arm-swing. No difficulty with heel , or toe walk. Falls
to left on tandem gait.
Non-contrast head CT negative for evidence of stroke or hemorrhage.
Hospital course: the pt was admitted with hypertension and recent
headaches , visual changes ( blurred vision ) , change in gait ( inability
to walk in heels ) , and recent confusion. Neurologic exam was
significant for right hypertropic skew without diplopia , left facial
weakness that is old per pt and LMR notes , mild slowing of right fine
finger movements , and tendency to fall towards the left on tandem gait.
These findings do not localize well and the differential diagnosis
was felt to include cerebral ischemia/infarction and hypertensive
encephalopathy. The patient had recent poorly-controlled
hypertension as well as symptoms of possible heart failure including
exertional dyspnea and orthopnea.
An MRI was ordered to evaluate for possible stroke or hypertensive
encephalopathy. Unfortunately , the pt was not able to tolerate the
procedure , citing claustrophobia from a traumatic childhood experience
as a prohibitive factor. Her atenolol was continued and she was placed
on aspirin 325 mg qd for stroke and heart prophylaxis. Her blood
pressures remained well-controlled throughout admission and she
remained asymptomatic , without recurrent headache , confusion , and
weakness. Her fine finger movements with the right hand were improved
by hospital day 2. She continued to have difficulty with tandem gait ,
falling to the left. Her lipid profile revealed elevated total
cholesterol and LDL. Her homocysteine level was slightly elevated at
14. She was instructed to raise her dose of atorvastatin as well as
supplement her diet with folic acid. She has an outpt appointment for
carotid non-invasive studies 10/25/03.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
The pt should take a full dose of aspirin ( 325 mg ). She should take
folate supplementation. She should also discuss raising her dose of
atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) with her PCP , because her cholesterol and LDL
were elevated this admission.
