BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
50 yo with CAD s/p PTCA with stent to 1st diag in 1999 , also with
chronic lower back pain with intrathecal morphine pump. Presents with
chest pain in context of 12 hours nausea/vomiting/dry heave likely
secondary to morphine withdrawal from malfunctioning pump. Chest pain
relieved with SL NTG x3. Enzyme leak , troponin 1.3 at outside hospital
--&gt; NQWMI. Pt transferred for cath to evaluate stent. Cath 5/10/01
showed patent D1 stent , 50% LAD , 60% PDA with likely accelerated
idioventricular rhythm post cath. He was transferred to cards
for evaluation of rhythm and optimization of cardiac management.
Pt has been asymptomatic on morphine PCA ( pending arrival of
intrathecal pump infusion per pain service ). HTN was controlled with
clonidine , and his ECG normalized. Chest pain was thought
to be secondary to increased demand during acute withdrawal. Will
Pump was refilled per pain service , and his cardiac regimen was
optimized. Outpatient cardiology follow up with stress test to risk
stratify was arranged. Patient's urine output was marginal on 3/16/01 .
He was hydrated with modest response. BUN and creatinine were stable.
