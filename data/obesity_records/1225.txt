Hospital Course:
62yo F with HTN , asthma and recent L total knee replacement
presented with extensive PE. She was extremely SOB and c/o pleuritic
chest pain. Her ekg and exam were not suggestive of cardiac
dysfunction. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient was initially
anticoagulated with Heparin. However , her platelets were noted to drop
from 237 to 93. HIT was suspected and Heparin was discontinued. The
patient was started on Fondaparinux. A PF4 Antibody was sent and pending
at the time of discharge. Coumadin was started after one day of
Fondaparinux with an intent to bridge over at least 5 days with a goal
INR of 2-3. The patient's blood pressure was decreased over the course of
her admission. All antihypertensives were held. She may be preload
dependent in the setting of an acute PE. During her admission an
echocardiogram was performed. It did not show evidence of right heart
strain or LV dysfunction. Her EF was 65-70%. Over the course of the
hospitalzation , the patient's symptoms improved dramatically. Her oxygen
requirement decreased. Her vital signs remained stable.
The patients respiratory status remained stable on home regiment
of inhalers and nebulizers PRN.
Ortho evaluated the patient while hospitalized and recommended weight
bearing as tolerated. The patient did not require narcotics for pain
associated with TKR.
Heparin products should be avoided. The PF4 antibody will need to be
followed by the PCP.
