Discharge Date: 9/3/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SYNCOPE.
PROBLEMS: 1. SYNCOPE.
2. ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION.
3. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old white male with
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy who was
admitted with syncope. He is status post myocardial infarction in
1979 and 1985 as well as a coronary artery bypass graft in 1987
with a LIMA to LAD , SVG to RCA , SVG to OMB. Over the past ten
years he has complained of increasing CHF symptoms including
dyspnea on exertion , fatigue , chest tightness and has had multiple
admits for exacerbations , the most recent from November to
March , 2001 for progressive fatigue. At that time a right
heart catheterization revealed high filling pressures and he was
treated with aggressive diuresis. Angiography revealed occluded
SVGs and a patent LIMA. Dobutamine radionuclide study revealed
inferior and inferolateral infarct. There was no evidence of
revascularization. Evaluation for heart transplant found cirrhosis
by liver spleen scan which ruled out the possibility of transplant.
He reported light-headedness and dizziness and was seen by the
Electrophysiology Service who performed an EP study which was
negative for provokable VT and since he is not a transplant
candidate it was felt that empiric ICD placement would not be in
his best interest. His light-headedness and presyncope worsened.
His captopril dose was reduced from 37.5 mg to 25 mg t.i.d. with
marked improvement in his energy and less dizziness. Over the past
weeks his dizziness and light-headedness recurred and worsened with
episodes of presyncope and frank syncope. On the day of admission
he was scheduled for a clinic appointment. On arrival he felt
dizzy and "crumpled" with loss of consciousness and therefore was
admitted for further evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of 15% to 20% in February of 2001 ,
status post anterior MI in 1980 and 1986 , three vessel CABG in 1987
with LIMA to LAD , SVG to OM and SVG to PDA , type 2 diabetes
mellitus , insulin dependent , hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis ,
gallstones , cardiac cirrhosis which is mild and was diagnosed in
February 2001 by abdominal ultrasound and liver scan , IBS , psoriasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH
insulin 65 units subcu b.i.d. , Xanax p.r.n. , torsemide 120 mg p.o.
q.a.m. , torsemide 80 mg p.o. q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Synthroid 250 mcg p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Lying blood pressure
94/58 , heart rate 70 , oxygen
saturation 97% on room air. Sitting blood pressure 78/54. Patient
could not stand secondary to light-headedness to complete
orthostatic vital signs. Afebrile. General: Appearing
comfortable in a supine position. No acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Regular. Normal S1 , S2. No S3. JVP
approximately 5 cm. A II/VI holosystolic murmur at apex. Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , non-tender ,
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No edema.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 128 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 91 ,
bicarbonate 22 , BUN 64 , creatinine 2.6 ,
glucose 348. White blood cell count 17.9 , hematocrit 37.6 ,
platelets 286.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: None.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old white male with history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary
artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy and probably cardiac
cirrhosis who presents with presyncope and syncope. The arrhythmia
was considered possible and there has been none documented and he
was not inducible two years prior to admission. Given his
orthostatic vital signs it was felt that his volume status and
medications were responsible for his symptoms. In addition his
elevated BUN and creatinine were consistent with volume depletion.
He improved off diuretics , nitrates and ACE inhibitor as well as
liberalization of his diet regarding salt and fluid intake. There
were no arrhythmias noted on his telemetry monitor. An endocrine
consult was called to evaluate for possible contribution of
autonomic insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. They
recommended decreasing his Synthroid dose due to a suppressed TSH
as well as more aggressive blood sugar control , however , they were
unable to document orthostatic hypotension and felt that his
episodes of presyncope and syncope were related to his volume
status and medications rather than autonomic insufficiency.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: To be dictated on the actual day of
discharge.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Satisfactory.
DISPOSITION: Home with services.
