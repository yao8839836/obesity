HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient's shortness of breath was
attributed to her CHF , and the patient was treated with Lasix 80
mg IV b.i.d. with a goal of greater than 1 liter negative per
day. The patient's weight was monitored daily. On admission , it

saturation was 99% on room air. The patient did have some
intermittent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
She remained asymptomatic. Her electrolytes were repleted

mg to 25 mg t.i.d. As a result , the patient was sent home on
Toprol 75 mg daily instead of her prior home dose of 50 mg daily.
The patient had cardiac enzymes checked because of her
intermittent episodes of NSVT. The patient's troponin was less
than assay. She was continued on aspirin , spironolactone ,
