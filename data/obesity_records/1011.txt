the patient had a positive UA growing gram-negative rods , an
elevated BNP , and a chest x-ray consistent with CHF exacerbation.
The patient was diuresed with Bumex and started on IV

25. Urinalysis was cloudy , large LE , 3+ bacteria , 40-50 white
blood cells. ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation with a
moderate ventricular response , occasional PVCs apparently
conducted diffuse nonspecific ST-T abnormalities , left axis
deviation , no prior EKG for comparison.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Chest x-ray performed on 1/1/2006
by Jacqulyn Harkley showing mild pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram
performed on 1/1/2006 by Nerissa Robblee showing no significant
change from previous done 8/10/2003. Ejection fraction of 25% ,
left atrium 5 cm mildly enlarged , global hypokinesia , no obvious
thrombi , PA SBP 57 mmHg. EEG performed on 5/25/2006 by Gerri Jiau was consistent with mild encephalopathy of toxic ,
metabolic , traumatic , or other origins. No definitive , focal , or
epileptiform features. Previous EEG done on 9/17/2006 revealed
similar findings. Head CT on 5/25/2006 by Shea Bohanan showed
prominent ventricles and sulci that appear appropriate for the
patient's age. No acute intracranial process.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted with an elevated
BNP and chest x-ray consistent with CHF flare , likely secondary
to UTI. On arrival to the floor , the patient was hemodynamically
stable and asymptomatic. EKG and one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative for cardiac ischemia and his home cardiac medications
were restarted. On examination , the patient had elevated JVP and
edema , suggesting that he was volume overloaded. The patient
responded to diuresis with torsemide 5 mg IV and metolazone 2.5
mg by mouth. He was switched to his home dose of torsemide 30 mg
p.o. and was euvolemic on discharge. Echocardiogram was
performed on 5/25/2006 to rule out structure etiologies for CHF
flare. Results showed no significant change from previous echo
done on 6/27/2006. The patient was on telemetry during the
hospital course and was noted to have atrial fibrillation with
premature ventricular contractions. He remained asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital course.
2. ID: UTI contributing to his CHF flare and MS changes.
Urinalysis was positive and the outside hospital reported
Gram-negative rods. The patient was continued on a 10-day course
of p.o. Levaquin. TP-IgG was negative.
3. Pulmonary: Chest x-ray on admission was consistent with mild
interstitial pulmonary edema. The patient remained asymptomatic
with no oxygen requirement. The patient responded well to
diuretic therapy for CHF flare.
4. Neurology: The patient's altered mental status was thought
to be secondary to urinary tract infection without metabolic
causes. B12 , folate , TSH , and T4 were within normal limits.
TP-IgG was negative. Iron was slow with small hypochromia on
smear , suggesting mild iron deficiency. EEG was also performed
on 5/25/2006 as this patient displayed fluctuations in cognitive
function that could be related to seizure activity. EEG was
nondiagnostic for epileptiform features. The patient was started
on Keppra 500 mg twice a day. His mental status appeared to be at baseline at
time of discharge
5. Renal: Creatinine 1.4 , baseline creatinine was monitored
during diuresis. Creatinine trended down to 1.3 on discharge.
Gross hematuria was present upon arrival to floor secondary to
patient pulling on catheter in his altered mental state. Bladder
scan ruled out obstruction and the bladder was irrigated to
remove clots. As the patient's mental status improved , he no
longer pulled on the catheter and the hematuria resolved. He
continued to have some bleeding around the catheter secondary to
BPH and the trauma from manipulation of the catheter.
6. Wounds: The patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the left
Achilles , recently seen at I Warho Hospital by Dr.
Authur , Plastic Surgery. He saw the patient and recommended
Panafil spray for the wound and frequent dressing changes. The
patient will follow up with Dr. Authur as an outpatient.
7. GI: Distended abdomen with question of ascites. LFTs
returned within normal limits , no indication for ultrasound.
8. Hematology: Hematuria as described above which resolved with
improved mental status. The patient's hematocrit remained stable
throughout the hospital course. The patient has a history of
elevated INR , resistant to p.o. and subcutaneous vitamin K.
Records from Flofry Bradlrel Memorial Hospital suggest that the patient has factor
VII deficiency. The patient had no episodes of uncontrollable
bleeding or symptoms suggesting anticoagulative state.
9. Endocrine: Continued the patient's home dose of Synthroid.
Diabetes type 2 covered Lantus 10 units and insulin aspart
sliding scale.
10: Fen: Potassium/magnesium scales. cardiac ,
low salt diet.
11. Prophylaxis: Proton pump inhibitor , Lovenox.
12. Code: The patient is DNR/DNI. There were no complications.
