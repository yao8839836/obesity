*****
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 86F with hx CHF , Afib , CKD , and diabetes who
was admitted with partial SBO , bilateral aspiration pneumonia , and CHF
exacerbation.
-
GI: Admitted with partial SBO. She was treated wtih conservative
management. No NGT was required. The SBO resolved and she was passing
stool and tolerating a normal diet.
-
CV: She has a history of diastolic dysfunction. Echo 8/27 with EF 45-50% ,
no RWMA , mod LAE and RAE , bioprosthetic MV w/ tr MR , tr AR , severe TR ,
mild-mod PR. She reported SOB prior to admission which ws thought to be
due to a CHF exacerbation. She was not agressively diuresed in the
setting of the partial SBO. She is on variable doses of lasix
( 80-200mg po bid ) at home. She was initially given lasix 80mg bid which
required additional doses of lasix iv prn to diurese , so the dose was
increased to 160mg po bid. Repeat CXR on 3/17 looks a little better than
admission. Overall her SOB and hypoxia improved. She no longer required
supplemental oxygen. She has a history of hypertension and was continued
on norvasc and imdur. She also has a history of Afib , now on coumadin.
Her rate was adequately controlled. The coumadin was initially held due
to possible procedures related to the SBO. The INR remained in 2-3 range ,
likely due to the antibiotics. The Coumadin was restarted on 10/20 as the
INR was trending down , and was started at lower dose ( 2mg instead of 3mg )
given the antibiotics. Her INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as
an outpatient.
-
Pulmonary: She has a history of aspiration PNA. The Abd CT showed
bilateral lower lobe PNA , likely aspiration. She was treated with levo
and flagyl. Her WBC was elevated on admission and decreased during
hospitalization. She was afebrile. With treatment of the pneumonia and
CHF she was no longer hypoxic or SOB. She will continue levofloxacin and
flagyl for an 8-day course.
-
Renal: She has a history of CKD with Cr baseline of 2.6-2.8. Her Cr was
2.6 on admission and 2.3 on discharge. She continued home sevelamer.
-
Diabetes: Her insulin was initially held on admission due to NPO for the
SBO. When her SBO resolved and she was eating again , her home regimen of
lantus 100 units daily , Novolog 5 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale
was restarted. Her fingersticks continued to be high , perhaps due to
pneumonia. The insulin was titrated up for better glucose control to
Lantus 12 units daily , Novolog 7 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale.
The daughter is a nurse and will monitor and adjust her insulin at home.
HbA1c 8.2.
-
ID: Treatment for aspiration pneumonia as above with levofloxacin and
flagyl. Ucx with mixed flora.
-
Heme: Hct at baseline. As above , her INR remained high off coumadin ,
likely due to the antibiotics. Coumadin restarted on 10/20 at a lower
dose. INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as an outpatient
-
Nutrition: She had a radiologic swallowing evaluation which showed deep
laryngeal penetration with thin and nectar-thick liquid with no
aspiration and a tiny Zenker diverticulum. Diet recommendations were
ground diet ( for lack of teech ) and thin liquids.
-
Disposition: PT recommended rehab. Patient and daughter prefer patient to
go home w/ services. The daughter is a nurse. New PCP is Dr. Jagla
( geriatrics ) at 12/10 at 2pm at
P Therford Hospital .

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Pneumonia: She will be discharged on levofloxacin and flagyl to treat
her pneumonia to complete an 8-day course , which will end on 6/20
2. CHF: She will continue to take the lasix.
3. Hypertension: She should continue to take her previous medications.
4. Diabetes: Her insulin has been increased during hospitalization.
Continue to monitor the glucose levels and adjusting her insulin.
5. Coumadin: Her coumadin was restarted on 10/20 at 2pm ( lower dose than
prior due to the effect of antibiotics increasing the INR ). However , her
INR has been low at 1.5 and 1.4 , so the coumadin has been increased to
3mg at discharge. Continue to monitor her INR and adjust her coumadin as
needed.
6. Continue home PT as recommended.
7. Seek medical attention if she develops fever , chills , shortness of
breath , chest pain , worsening cough , or any other concerning symptoms.
8. The patient has an appointment with a new PCP , Dr. Jagla of the Dept
of Geriatrics , on 7/10/07 at Norap Valley Hospital .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Pneumonia: Patient will complete an 8-day course of levo and flagyl.
Monitor for resolution of pneumonia.
2. CHF: Patient will continue lasix. Continue to monitor volume status.
3. Afib: Patient will continue coumadin , will be monitored and adjusted
by Coumadin Clinic.
4. Diabetes: Patient will continue insulin regimen at home.
5. PCP: Patient will have a new PCP , Dr. Jagla , who she will see on 10/8
