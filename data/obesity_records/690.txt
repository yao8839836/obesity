16/0.8 , glucose 126.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient admitted to the Thoracic Surgery
Service on 6/29/99 and taken to the Operating

placed intraoperatively did not have a leak. The patient was
followed by the Internal Medicine Service. The patient went into
rapid atrial fibrillation postoperatively. She was placed on a
rule out myocardial infarction and seen by the Cardiology Service.
The patient was successfully converted into a normal sinus rhythm
using Diltiazem IV. This was converted to p.o. Diltiazem. The
patient's postoperative course was largely unremarkable but for
dysrhythmia. She was on no antibiotics. She required diuresis
with Lasix 40 q.d. for home. The patient's pain was well
controlled with p.o. pain medications , Percocet.
