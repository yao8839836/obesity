Discharge Date: 3/23/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old man
from Ins , with a his-
tory of ischemic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure , who
was transferred to the Totin Hospital And Clinic for transplant evalua-
tion. In 1975 , he suffered a myocardial infarction and subse-
quently had exertional angina. In 2 of March he suffered a second MI
and underwent three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 8 of May
At that time his ejection fraction was 21%. Over the ensuing
months , the patient noted markedly worsening symptoms of CHF with
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and dyspnea on exertion.
One week prior to transfer , the patient was admitted to Cock Dia Medical Center for management of his congestive heart failure. He was
initially treated with afterload reduction , digoxin and Lasix.
On this regimen , a PA line was placed with the following read-
ings: RA 8 , RV 76/4 , TA 80/36 , pulmonary capillary wedge pres-
sure 34 , and cardiac index 1.49. Echocardiogram revealed dilated
left ventricle with global hypokinesis , tricuspid regurgitation ,
and PA systolic pressure 80mmHg. The patient was treated with
dobutamine , intravenous TNG , and nitroprusside with symptomatic
relief and hemodynamic stabilization with wedge pressure falling
to 18. TNG and Nipride were successfully weaned. However , the
patient remained dobutamine dependent.
The patient was transferred to the Totin Hospital And Clinic for evalu-
ation for transplantation. At the time of admission he noted
dyspnea on minimal exertion but not at rest. He denied chest
pain , palpitations , lightheadedness , or syncope. The patient is
married , and worked as a janitor until October of 1991. He is
married with seven children and lives in Ver Racho .
The patient's PAST MEDICAL HISTORY is significant for severe
abdominal trauma many years ago , having been gored by a bull.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Discharge physical examination is nota-
ble for a blood pressure of 100/50 , a
heart rate of between 100 and 110 , a respiratory rate of 18 , a
blood pressure of 112/66 , a temperature of 97.1 , and a weight of
80.4 kilograms. The patient is in normal sinus rhythm with occa-
sional short bursts of ventricular tachycardia last two days
prior to discharge. LUNGS: Occasional crackles. HEART: Sounds
distant. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: Trace edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Discharge sodium 134 , potassium 4.2 , BUN
32 , creatinine 1.4. White count 9.8 ,
hematocrit 29.2 , platelets 253. ALT 14 , AST 8 , LDH 223 , total
bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.3 , albumin 2.8 , total protein
5.9 , cholesterol 106.
MEDICATIONS at time of discharge include dobutamine at 15 mcg per
kilogram per minute; captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; digoxin 0.125
mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d.; potassium chloride 20 mEq
p.o. b.i.d.; Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q.d.; Atrovent , two puffs q.i.d.;
Azmacort , eight puffs b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Colace
100 mg p.o. t.i.d.; vancomycin 1 gm q. 12 , discontinued 9-23 a.m.
after 14 days; ampicillin 2 gm IV q. 6 ( 27 of June equals day number
five ); Halcion 0.125 p.o. q.h.s. prn; Serax 15 mg p.o. q. 6 hours
prn.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Transplant Listing: The patient has
been listed for cardiac transplant ,
has had all the necessary preoperative workup including pulmonary
function tests and tissue typing. Should a heart become avail-
able , he could be Medivacked back to the Pagham University Of for surgery.
The patient's hospital course was significant for the following
workup: He had a catheterization 27 of January , which showed patent
grafts and occluded native left anterior descending and obtuse
marginal branch. An echocardiogram on 15 of July showed mitral regurg-
itation , an ejection fraction of less than 20% , and no vegeta-
tions on the valve.
The patient's most significant problem during his hospital course
included temperatures. On 26 of November , he had an increased temperature
to 101 and increased white count with left shift. His central
line was pulled , and the tip grew gram positive cocci. The
patient also grew gram positive cocci from two blood cultures.
He was started on vancomycin and defervesced , and has been
afebrile for four days.
Subsequently , the patient again became febrile approximately one
week into his vancomycin course. At this point he was recul-
tured , and those cultures grew gram negative rods in one out of
four blood culture specimens. These were gram negative enteric
rods , pan-sensitive , for which the patient was started on
ampicillin 2 gm IV q. 6. This was felt most likely secondary to
a urinary tract infection from the Foley catheter , which has been
discontinued.
At the time of discharge , the patient is stable , dobutamine
dependent , without chest pain , able to ambulate from chair to
commode without shortness of breath , palpitations , or light-
headedness. He is eager to be transferred back to the Paul Wa , Georgia 88247 area to await heart transplant.
With any questions , please contact Doctor Loan Kuharik Pagham University Of 138-8931 , beeper number 1693 , the patient's
medical intern.
The patient's condition at time of discharge is fair.
DISPOSITION: Continuing care in the coronary care
unit of the hospital inpatient near
patient's home. The patient will be under the care of a Doctor
