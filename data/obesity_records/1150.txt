CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest and epigastric pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman who
is having a significant amount of GI
distress with belching and gas over several months to years who
presents with three hours of upper abdominal and chest discomfort
which she described after a fall day of volunteering and doing her
exercise. Actually she was sitting down to eat and then developed
this symptom that lasted for about three hours. The patient did
not that she has run out of her Atenolol for more than three days
prior to admission and came to the Emergency Room when her pain did
not resolve after taking some Tums and some water. The patient
denies any previous history of angina. She came into the Emergency
Room and had a blood pressure of 190/97 with a normal EKG. The
patient was given 5 mg of Lopressor and started back on her
Atenolol with decrease of her heart rate and blood pressure and
resolution of her symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesteremia.
ALLERGIES: Streptomycin.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.
2. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg q d.
4. Niacin 250 mg b.i.d.
5. Colace.
6. Multivitamin.
7. NPH insulin 20 units q a.m.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a senior's home. She does
not smoke or drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: She was afebrile. Blood
pressure 150/90 , heart rate 84. O2
saturation was 94-97% on room air. GENERAL: The patient was a
pleasant obese woman in no acute distress , belching during her
history. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation except for
some initial left basilar crackles , which have cleared. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops or rubs.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. RECTAL: Heme negative , per
examination in the Emergency Room. EXTREMITIES: She did have some
bilateral trace edema. NEUROLOGIC: Non-focal.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: SMA-7 was significant for a glucose 236. CPK
was 74 , troponin 0.04. CBC and coags were
normal. Chest x-ray did show a top normal cardiac silhouette with
mild evidence of CHF. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute
ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Short Stay Unit.
She was put on cardiac telemetry and was ruled
out for myocardial infarction with serial CPKs and EKGs. She had
no further episodes of her discomfort but did have continued
belching. On further discussion with the patient , she was actually
a relatively active woman who did not have any anginal symptoms in
the past and never described any shortness of breath , PND or
orthopnea. The plan was made to get an echocardiogram and do an
adenosine stress test. Her adenosine stress test was negative for
chest pain or EKG changes and her MIBI was negative for fixed
reversible defects. She therefore was felt to be negative for
ischemia. However , on her MIBI and her echocardiogram she did have
a mildly decreased LV function of 40-45% , of unknown significance
and unknown etiology. It was felt that this could be further
worked up for other causes , including sending out for TSH , SPEP ,
UPEP , and iron studies as an outpatient , as the patient was anxious
to leave the hospital. This could be done in clinic by her primary
care physician.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on her admission
medications with the addition of Axid 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and simethicone 80 q.i.d. p.r.n. for her gas. The patient
will discuss her GI symptoms with her primary care physician and
would benefit from further workup as an outpatient. The patient
was discharged in stable condition with no adverse drug reactions.
The patient will follow up with Dr. Ola Fraschilla in approximately
one to two weeks.
