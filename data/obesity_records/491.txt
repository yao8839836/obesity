1 ) CV: HTN: Unclear precipitant for intermittent HTN - ?2/2 renal
known renal artery stenosis , HR lability , autonomic syndrome.
Given h/o tachy-brady and difficult to control afib w/bradycardia and
documented pauses , EP was consulted and a dual chamber GUIDANT pacemaker
inserted without difficulty on 2/22 - programmed to DDI 60 mode. BB was
initiated and plan to continue Toprol XL upon discharge. Plan to continue
clindamycin qid to complete 3 day course and to f/u with EP in 2wks. Upon
discharge , pt's hr 60 , bp 130s/70s.
Anticoagulation-discussion on previous admit initiated with cardiology

anticoagulation , but deferred decision to pt's outpatient cardiologist
Dr. Krinsky . Plan for this admission is the same- continue pt's home ASA and
Plavix now , with plan to f/u with Dr. Krinsky for discussion of risks/benefits
of initiating coumadin.
