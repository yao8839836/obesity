To be determined.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Increased dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This 62-year-old male with morbid obesity , hypertension , chronic
renal insufficiency , prior MI presents with increased lower
extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion over the last several
months. Some of this has been attributed to volume overload and
the patient has had an increased creatinine from approximately in
early February of this year to 5.5 in September .  The patient had
previously refused dialysis , but agreed a few weeks ago to begin
the process of dialysis and was scheduled for a fistula
evaluation next week. However , in the past few days , his dyspnea
on exertion has accelerated. Whereas , he used to be able to walk
40 to 50 feet without shortness of breath , he is now only able to
walk 10 feet. Therefore , he is presenting to the emergency
department. In the emergency department , he got his home CPAP ,
was noted on chest x-ray ( of poor quality ) to have a question of
a left lower lobe consolidation and therefore received one dose
of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. His BNP was elevated to 1663
( from 655 one year ago ) and his creatinine rose to 5.9 from 5.5
in September and 4.1 in February .  Therefore the patient was felt to
have also an element of volume overload and he was admitted to
the renal service for consideration of dialysis and volume
removal.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes type II.
3. Morbid obesity.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Pulse 92 , blood pressure 160/70 , respirations 18 , 95% on room
air. The patient is wearing his CPAP. He is falling asleep
during the interview. He is in no apparent distress. Heart is
regular rate and rhythm. Heart sounds are distant , but S1 , S2
are heard. There is no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. JVP cannot be
determined. The patient has crackles at the right base. Abdomen
is markedly obese with significant lateral edema particularly on
the left side where his pannus tends to fall. There is
significant scrotal edema. The scrotum appears to be about 7
inches in diameter. The patient has bilateral 3+ pitting leg
edema. He has 2+ DP pulses bilaterally. He has closed ulcers on
his abdomen which he states that have been there for several
years and that he tends to pick at them daily to make them bleed.
LABORATORY EXAM:
Sodium 145 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 107 , bicarb 21 , BUN 68 ,
creatinine 5.9 , glucose 53 , lipase 11 , total bili 1.0 , alk phos
153 , BNP 1663 , calcium 7.8 , phosphate 7.3 , magnesium 1.8 ,
troponin less than assay , white blood cell count 6.2 , hematocrit
33.3 , platelets 144 , 000 , INR 1.3 , BNP was 1663.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacification , but the patient
was not able to stand for a lateral chest x-ray.
EKG showed first-degree AV block with poor R wave progression and
a question of Q waves in 3 and AVF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Renal: The patient was felt to be in volume overload. His
chronic renal insufficiency was progressing likely for several
reasons including his chronic hydronephrosis. his focal segmental
glomerular sclerosis , diabetes , and hypertension. He was
initially given large amounts of Lasix but he failed to diurese
significantly and his creatinine rose to approximately 7.0.
Therefore , a tunneled catheter was placed by vascular surgery and
the patient began urinalysis with the purpose of taking out of
volume. Approximately 20 liters of volume were taken off over
several days of dialysis. The patient will continue hemodialysis
three times a week as an outpatient. In addition , he had venous
ultrasound mapping for likely placement of a permanent AV
fistula.
2. Pulmonary: The patient continued to wear his CPAP for his
severe obstructive sleep apnea. His breathing improved somewhat
during his hospitalization but it was not possible to tell how
well he would do if he would attempt to walk again as he was
sedentary and in bed for his entire hospitalization except for
occasionally sitting up on the side of the bed and moving to a
bed chair once or twice.
3. Infectious Disease: There was not clear evidence of pneumonia
critically or on review of the chest x-ray and therefore the
patient was not specifically treated for pneumonia. However ,
upon placement of a Foley catheter , there was a significant
amount of white blood cells in the urine and while the urine
culture appeared not to be negative , the patient was treated with
a 10-day course of levofloxacin ( renally adjusted ) for urinary
tract infection. Foley catheter was initially placed by urology.
Due to difficulties in the anatomy , it may get hard to place.
Once Foley catheter was removed , the patient was able to urinate
on his own.
4. Cardiovascular:
A. Rhythm: The patient was maintained on sotalol and a
beta-blocker for his prior history of ventricular tachycardia.
He did not have any episodes while inhouse on this
hospitalization. The patient's electrophysiologist Dr. Denisha H Mcrorie suggested that given that the patient is on hemodialysis ,
the sotalol should be reduced to 40 mg three times a week to be
given approximately two hours after dialysis. The plan was to
monitor the QT interval and discontinue sotalol as a QT interval
or if the QTC were greater than 500 msecs. A QTC was monitored
during this hospitalization and never exceeded 500 msecs.
Therefore , the sotalol should be continued at this dose on
dialysis days.
B. Ischemia: He is much ruled out for MI. He was maintained on
aspirin , statin , and a beta-blocker.
C. Pump: The patient was volume overloaded on admission and
improved after significant volume reduction by hemodialysis. A
review of the patient's prior cardiac echoes showed that in
9/30 he had an ejection fraction of approximately 70%. In
2/19 , his ejection fraction fell to about 45 to 50%. On
repeat echocardiogram during this admission , a repeat
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of about 30 to 35%
with a mildly dilated left ventricle , moderately reduced left
ventricular function. Akinesis in the entire apex of the basal
septum segment and the basal posterior segment of the heart and
hypokinesis in the anterior wall , the anterior lateral wall , the
inferior wall , and the mid anterior septum segment. There is
mild mitral regurgitation. No tricuspid regurgitation and trace
aortic regurgitation without any significant evidence of aortic
stenosis.

TO DO:
The patient will receive hemodialysis three times a week on
Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays.
The patient will follow up with Dr. Fran Bussler as an outpatient
within three or four weeks.
The QTC intervals should be monitored every week while at rehab
or at a regular doctor's appointment as an outpatient to ensure
that it is less than 500. If it is greater than 500 , then the
frequency of sotalol administration should be decreased in order
to maintain a QTC of less than 500 msecs.
