Discharge Date: 10/15/2005
ATTENDING: DEANDRA LAZARO GILFOY MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Pneumonia.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: NSTEMI , pneumonia.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right hip and knee pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 76-year-old woman with a
history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
three-vessel CAD , lung cancer , status post lobectomy in October
2003 who on the day of admission was getting out of bed at home
and had a mechanical fall due to right leg weakness. The patient
was noted to be pale and diaphoretic at this time. The patient
had recently noticed an increase in her baseline , severe dyspnea
on exertion , there was no loss of consciousness , trauma , or
prodrome associated with this mechanical fall. The patient
denied chest pain on admission to PUO . She had left shoulder
pain and complained of right scapular pain in the emergency room.
The patient had been recently discharged from PUO after
admission for herniated disc at L2 and L3 with right nerve root
impingement. In the emergency room , the chest x-ray was
remarkable for a left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient also had
an elevated troponin at 0.19. The EKG in the emergency room
showed 0.5 mm increase in ST depressions in the inferolateral
leads , which the patient had at baseline.

ALLERGIES:

2. Quinine leads to headache.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97 , blood pressure
106/52 , pulse 63 , respiratory rate 16 , saturation 94% on 2 liters
( the patient desaturated to 84% with minimal movement ). In
general , obese , tachypneic , ill-appearing woman. Neck veins
difficult to assess. CVS , distant heart sounds. Pulmonary ,
bibasilar rales. Abdomen , obese , nontender , nondistended with
positive bowel sounds. Extremities , 1+ bilateral edema. Neuro ,
alert and oriented x3 , no focal deficits.
Labs on admission were significant for white blood cell count
equal to 12 with 25% bands and 56% polys , troponin on admission
0.19.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ID: The patient's decreased O2 saturation , chest x-ray
findings were all consistent with a left lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient was started on Levaquin for a seven-day course. The
patient's Levaquin was discontinued on 1/25/04 after a chest CT
showed no evidence of any further infiltrate in the left lower
lobe. The patient was able to be weaned off of oxygen and was
saturating in the high 90% at the time of discharge. The patient
also underwent urine , blood , and sputum cultures during this
admission , which showed no growth of any organism.
2. Pulmonary: The patient had a history of left upper lobe lung
cancer status post resection. The patient was continued on her
Flovent for management of likely COPD. She underwent a chest CT
during this admission , which showed no evidence a mass or
recurrence of her lung cancer.
3. Ischemia: The patient was found to have a troponin as high
as 23 during this admission and ruled in for a non-NSTEMI in the
setting of hypoxemia. The patient was continued on aspirin ,
statin beta-blocker and Ace inhibitor. She underwent a
dobutamine MIBI on 5/18/05 , which showed areas of periinfarct
ischemia most prominent at the anterior wall. The patient then
underwent a cardiac catheterization on 11/29/05 , which showed
left main disease at 50% as well as tight left circumferential
LAD and a 100% RCA lesion. The patient was then evaluated for
CABG in light of her three-vessel coronary artery disease. Due
to her multiple comorbidities , she underwent a preoperative
evaluation with the chest CT , carotid ultrasound , pulmonary
function test , and echocardiogram. The chest CT revealed no
evidence of lung cancer recurrence. Carotid ultrasound was
significant for bilateral ICA stenosis at 60%-65%. PFT showed an
FEV1 of 1.2 liters or 61% predicted with an FEV1/FVC ratio at 84%
predicted. The echo showed an EF of 55% with mild LVH , mild
hypokinesis of the inferior base and evidence of diastolic
dysfunction. Based on these test results , the patient was deemed
able to undergo CABG. The patient's surgery was scheduled for
6/19/05. The patient underwent preoperative evaluation by the
cardiac surgery team prior to discharged on 4/29/05.
4. Pump. On admission , the patient was thought to be volume
overloaded given her exam and chest x-ray findings. The patient
was given one dose of Lasix at 20 mg IV and had an adequate
diuresis. The patient was considered euvolemic during the rest
of her admission and required no additional doses of Lasix.
5. Rhythm. The patient was kept on telemetry during this
admission. There were no significant events and no EKG changes
outside of the increasing ST depression as seen on her admission
EKG.
6. Renal: The patient's initial creatinine on admission was
elevated at 1.6 from her baseline of 1.2. The patient's
creatinine trended down to 1.36 during the admission and remained
around her baseline until the time of discharge. Her creatinine
was closely monitored after cardiac catheterization and she
received mucomyst and IV fluids at the time of catheterization.
7. Endocrine: The patient was continued on her NPH and sliding
scale insulin during this admission. She was found to have an
enlarged thyroid on chest CT. Her TSH was found to be normal at
3.125. Her thyroid function should be followed as an outpatient.
8. Rheumatology. The patient has a history of PMR and was
continued on her prednisone dose at 10 mg q.d.
9. Code status: The patient remained a full code during this
admission.
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE:
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Dulcolax 10 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. constipation.
4. Colace 100mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Hydralazine 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.
6. NPH insulin 30 units , 16 units q.p.m. subcutaneous.
7. Lisinopril 60 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.a.m.
9. Flovent 44 mcg inhaled b.i.d.
10. Fosamax 35 mg p.o. q. week.
11. Atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. q.d.
12. Imdur 90 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
14. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
15. Vicodin one tablet p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. back pain.
FOLLOW-UP PLAN: The patient will follow up with cardiac surgery
on 10/24/05 for admission for CABG. The patient will also follow
up with Dr. Gaylene Faniel , her primary care doctor on 6/9/05 at
8.30 a.m.
