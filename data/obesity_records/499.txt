BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: chest pain
********************
HPI: 59 yo woman w/ CAD ( PCI 9/19 OM1 , RCA ) , obesity , OSA , asthma
p/w R sided chest pain x 3 days ( constant ) , not associated w/
exertion radiating to R shoulder , not relieved with
nitroglycerin. Also has had increasing SOB/nausea/vomiting as well
over this period. Took oxycodone/percocet w/ some relief of her chest
pain. Also c/o HA. No fever/chills. Also over past month , has had
flashes of light and then vision goes dark in R eye , not associated
with HA.

protocol-negative MRA neck 7/3/06 : No evidence of vascular

the internal carotid arteries.

inferior akinetic , basal superior dyskinetic , mid-posterior
hypokinetic unchanged from prev. No PFO
June clean coronaries ( stents patent )
********************
Impression and Plan: 59 yo w/ hx of CAD , diastolic dysfunction , OSA ,
p/w hypertensive emergency ( BP 190s in ED ) w/ troponin
leak likely as a result of increased BPs and demand.
Hospital Course by System:
*CV: In ED , BP was 198/109 with HR 98. Pt received given ASA 325 ,
Lopressor 5mg , Morphine 2mg , Nitro SL , Hydral 10mg , Dilaudid. BP
decreased to 120/78. EKG showed new T wave inversions in AVF and V6 with
pseudonormalization of T wave in AVL. CT chest negative for dissection.
Serial troponins were &lt;0.10 , 0.13 , &lt;0.10 , bump likely result of demand
ischemia. As pt's CP was reproducible on palpation , not likely to be of
cardiac source , somewhat improved with narcotics. Pt maintained on home
regimen , with BP control from 120-160/60-90 in house. Echo showed severe
LVH , EF 50-55% , diastolic dysfunction , basal inferior akinetic , basal
superior dyskinetic , mid-posterior hypokinetic , unchanged from prev. Pt
will follow up with outpatient cardiologist Dr. Reisman .
*Neuro: Pt described HA and episodes of vision loss in R eye lasting 5-10
minutes , concerning for amaurosis fugax vs atypical migraine vs temporal
arteritis ( had been biopsied for temporal arteritis in 10/5 because of
HA and elevated ESR - neg ). Neuro and Ophtho consulted. Pt described
vision loss as bilateral to consults - less concerning for embolic event.
MRA demonstrated no carotid stenosis or occlusion. ESR was only mildly
elevated at 32. Pt is already on aspirin , Plavix , statin and BP meds for
stroke prevention as per Neuro recs , though they recommended follow up
with outpatient Rheum to w/u temporal arteritis if sx continue. Ophtho
exam demonstrated typical dermoid in L eye ( unrelated to sx ) , retinal exam
showed evidence of PVD but no emboli , consult thought presentation not
consistent with giant cell arteritis , most likely atypical migraine.
*Pulm: Pt maintained on home regimen of Advair for asthma and CPAP at
night for OSA , no exacerbations in the hospital.
*Renal: Cr increased from 1.2 on admission ( baseline 1.0-1.8 , most likely
2/2 to chronic HTN ) to 1.7 on HD #2. Urine lytes demonstrated Na 100 Cl
78 Cr 152.3 ( FeNa 0.56% ) , UA showed 2+ LE. 10-15 WBC , 2+ bast6 , 1+ sq ,
but not treated because pt asymptomatic.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: -continue home medication regimen , but increase labetalol to 200
mg twice a day , norvasc to 5 mg twice a day , oxycontin dose to 50 mg
three times a day ( 40 mg home dose + 10 mg prescribed in hospital )
-make appointment to follow up with primary care physician Dr. Latonya C Dorsett
-follow up with cardiologist Dr. Reisman on 5/10 at 2:40 pm ( his office
will call you if an appointment can be made earlier )
-fluid restricted ( 2 L ) and salt restricted ( 2 mg ) diet
-return to hospital if symptoms worsen
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
-continue home regimen , but increased labetalol to 200 mg BID , norvasc to
5 mg BID , oxycontin dose from 40 mg to 50 mg TID
-f/u with cardiologist Dr. Reisman
-f/u with PCP Dr. Latonya Dorsett
-consider modification of HTN regimen if pressures not well controlled
No dictated summary
