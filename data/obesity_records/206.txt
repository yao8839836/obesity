HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old woman
with past medical history significant for osteopetrosis ,
persistent atrial fibrillation , baseline dementia , and
hypothyroidism who presents at a transfer from IIH
to the Pagham University Of with a nondisplaced hairline
fracture of the left femoral neck noted after the sudden
development of severe pain with ambulation on March , 2005.
Her husband describes her developing leg pain when weightbearing
as she was getting out of car in March , 2005. He denies any
recent fall and trauma. Transfer paper from HTH
suggest , the patient may have fallen prior to admission. Her

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.9 , pulse 94 ,
blood pressure 142/68 , respiratory rate 16 , and O2 saturation 94%
on room air. In general , the patient was somnolent , arousable ,
but confused but no apparent distress. HEENT: Normocephalic and
atraumatic. Anicteric sclerae. Pupils were equal and round to
light. She had moist mucous membranes and no lymphadenopathy.
Her neck was supple with full range of motion. Chest had faint
bilateral crackles at the bases right greater than left.
Cardiovascular: She had irregularly irregular rhythm. S1 and
S2. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs. JVD was less than 10 cm.
Abdomen: Soft and nontender and mildly distended with positive
bowel sounds. Extremities: There was no edema. DP were
palpable bilaterally. She was warm and well perfused. Neuro:
The patient was alert and oriented to self only. She was
somnolent , follow command , but no focal abnormalities were noted.
PERTINENT LABORATORY TESTS AND STUDIES: TSH within normal
limits. CT head on June , 2005 , showed a possible old small
left posterior frontal contusion. CT pelvis on June , 2005 ,
showed a hairline left femur fracture plus osteopetrosis. EKG
was irregularly irregular but otherwise unremarkable. Urine
cultures taken on March , 2005 , and February , 2005 ,
no growth to date. Stool Clostridium difficile , toxin assay has
been negative to date as well taken on the February , 2005.
Chest x-ray on admission was unremarkable. Chest x-ray following
surgery was significant for bilateral pleural effusions right
greater than left. Chest x-ray on the morning of discharge
significant for bilateral pleural effusion somewhat improved over
prior study.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: On January , 2005 , Dr. Eckloff did a
Girdlestone on May , 2005. Dr. Aspen , a left hip
hemiarthroplasty. Please see a full dictated operative notes for
details.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She is a 76-year-old female with atrial
fibrillation , dementia , and presenting with a left hip fracture
for orthopedic surgical correction on June , 2005. She had
a surgery but without complication and a postoperative course
complicated by delirium , atrial fibrillation with RVR , and new
hyponatremia.
1. Ortho: She presented with left femur hairline fracture. She
had a Girdlestone procedure performed and a left hemiarthroplasty
performed without complications. She was treated postoperatively
with cefazolin and has been discharged will be discharged on
Keflex. She developed a mild incisional cellulitis with no signs
of abscess and no fever.
2. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: She was screened preop in the determined
intermediate risk. She was given a beta-blocker for surgery and
has no signs of symptoms of ischemia throughout this
hospitalization.
B. Pump: The patient was found to be mildly hypertensive and
was started on lisinopril with good control.
C. Rhythm: The patient with known atrial fibrillation. She
developed a rapid ventricular response on postoperative day #3.
Heart rates in the 140s. Blood pressure was stable. This was
difficulty to control with IV and p.o. beta-blocker , calcium
channel blockers , and digoxin so she was IV amiodarone loaded and
is currently undergoing a p.o. amiodarone load as well. To date
on January , 2005 , she has had seven days of p.o. 400 mg t.i.d.
and with current loading plan is seven more days of 400 mg
amiodarone b.i.d. followed by 400 mg q.d. indefinitely. She is
currently weight controlled. Heart rates in the mid to low 60s.
She is getting amiodarone and Toprol-XL 300.
3. Neurology: The patient has baseline dementia and per husband
was developing delirium prior to transfer to Pagham University Of .  Differential diagnosis of this delirium infection
versus medications versus electrolytes. This is also complicated
by stress of surgery. Psychiatry was consulted , and initially
she was restarted on her Cymbalta. However , this was stopped
development of hyponatremia. Postoperatively , the patient has
slowly improved in terms of mental status and this new baseline
at discharge.
4. Infectious Disease: The patient has been afebrile
throughout. There was a report of a Gram-negative UTI at the
outside hospital for which she received a course of Levaquin.
She received postop prophylaxis of cefazolin until the September , 2005 , when this was stopped. Subsequently , she had increased
her white blood cell count to 23 , but no fever. UA , chest x-ray ,
and stool for C. diff was sent and are all negative to date. Her
white count has subsequently come down to 17 on the day of
discharge , and she has remained afebrile. Keflex was restarted
given the possible incisional site mild cellulitis , and she to be
continued until the staples were out after seven days course with
improvement. The patient developed a nonbloody diarrhea on
May , 2005. C. difficile studies were sent and have come
back negative to date. She was started on prophylactic dose of
Flagyl , which will be discontinued prior to discharge.
5. Pulmonary: The patient developed pleural effusion postop but
never was compromised in terms of oxygenation or ventilation.
She is making modest improvement at discharge and was self
diuresing.
6. Fluids , Electrolytes , and Nutrition: On admission , the
patient had a sodium of 140 which seems to gradually dropped to
her course to a nadir of 119 on the November , 2005. No obvious
med changes except for the SSRI that was subsequently stopped.
She was started on free-water restriction and urine lytes were
drawn. These lytes were consistent with picture of SIADH , so
free-water restriction has worked. On the day of discharge , her
sodium is 131 , and she should be continued on free-water
restriction and recheck in a week. Otherwise , electrolytes were
repleted p.r.n. The patient was given a low fat ADA diet.
7. Endocrine. The patient's sugars are moderately well
controlled on regular insulin sliding scale. NPH insulin was
added and has been titrated up to 12 units q.a.m. with regular
insulin sliding scale for coverage on top of that. The patient
with known hypothyroidism was euthyroid on admission. TSH was
within normal limit. Her home dose Synthroid continued and
should be indefinitely.
8. Hematology: Given the patient atrial fibrillation , she had
been on Coumadin at the outside hospital; however , on
presentation , her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2. She was put on
Lovenox prophylactic dose prior to the surgery , and following
surgery Coumadin was restarted and up titrated to 30 range. On
discharge , she was therapeutic with an INR of 2.0 , Coumadin dose
of 5 mg q.h.s. Her hematocrit has fell following the surgery ,
and she has transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells on
May , 2005. Since then , her hematocrit has increased
appropriately and she has been stable throughout her rest of
admission. On discharge , the hematocrit was 39.0.
9. Prophylaxis: Given her high risk for DVTs , the patient was
prophylactic with Lovenox while waiting for her INR to become
therapeutic. She also given pneumo boots and TED stocking.
Finally , she was given Nexium for peptic ulcer disease
prophylaxis. No consultants were called; however , the orthopedic
service initial have this patient contact would be Dr. Gaylene G Faniel .
At discharge , she is afebrile , T max of 97.9 , pulse between 49
and 64 , blood pressure between 98 and 120/44 to 60. She is
breathing 18 times per minute and satting between 94% and 98% on
room air. Fasting sugars have been well controlled. On exam ,
she is in no apparent distress. She is alert and oriented x2 to
place and person but not the time. She is also alert to her
situation. HEENT: Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.
She has anicteric sclerae. Chest exam , she has slightly
decreased breath sounds at the right base but no crackles or
wheezes. Cardiovascular: She has irregularly irregular S1 and
S2. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Abdomen: Soft and obese with
mildly distended positive bowel sounds , nontender. Extremities:
Warm and well perfused. She has left hip incision with staples
with no signs of dehiscence but a 5 cm round area of erythema
which is nontender. Neuro exam is nonfocal.
