LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: Sodium of 141 , K of 4.5 , chloride
of 105 , CO2 of 26 , BUN of 32 ,
creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of 110 , magnesium of 2.2. HEMATOLOGY:
White count of 7.5 , hematocrit of 32.3 , platelets of 216 , PT of 13 ,
with an INR of 1.1 , a PTT of 59.3. Cardiac catheterization was
done on 6/12/03 , which showed a 30% proximal LAD , right dominant
circulation , ventriculogram of 49 , PA mean of 30 , pulmonary
capillary wedge of 15 , cardiac output of 3.7 , and cardiac index of
2.2.
Patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Service on 6/12/03 ,
needed a pre-op echo , which was obtained on 7/7/03 , which showed
mild LV hypertrophy with preserved overall systolic function , EF of
about 55% , with right ventricle with normal size and function ,
aortic valve mildly thickened; however , leaflet excursion is good ,
the peak transaortic velocity is 2 mm per second consistent with a
peak instantaneous gradient of 60 mmHg. The mitral annulus is
thickened and calcified. There is mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. The peak antegrade mitral velocity is 1.8 ,
consistent with a maximal gradient of approximately 12. The valve
area is estimated at approximately 1.8 cm2. Mild tricuspid
regurgitation was noted , with a regurgitant velocity of 2.5 ,
consistent with normal pulmonary systolic pressures. Due to her
nonhealing ulcer for which she has been evaluated by Derm for over
a year , patient was seen by Vascular Surgery to evaluate for
vascular compromise as a component of these nonhealing ulcers.
ABIs were obtained , which showed both left and right ABIs greater
than 1 , also PVRs were normal throughout and it was felt that there
was no vascular component to these nonhealing ulcers , and they
recommended that it was due to venous stasis changes and chronic
edema and felt local wound care and leg elevation would be the
treatment of choice at this point. Patient , with some evidence of
poor dentition , was seen by the Dental Team , which felt that there
was no evidence of active infection at this time that needed
further dental treatment prior to her surgery. Due to her plan for
valve replacement , patient was empirically started on vancomycin ,
levofloxacin , and Flagyl for coverage of these nonhealing ulcers.
Patient was also seen by Dermatology , who felt these were venous
stasis ulcers and recommended Hibiclens wash , as well as Silvadene
dressing with Xeroform gauze , and leg elevation , and also
recommended lower noninvasive to rule out DVT , which was obtained
on 4/25/03 which showed no evidence of DVT. On 8/11 patient was
taken down to the operating room and underwent a mitral valve
replacement , with preservation of the posterior mitral leaflet , and
had a Hancock porcine valve placed. Total cardiopulmonary bypass
time was 126 minutes. Cross-clamp time was 89 minutes. Patient
came off the heart-lung machine on Levophed and was paced with an
internal pacer and was started on some IV amiodarone for
uncontrolled A fib immediately coming off the heart-lung machine.
Over the next few hours , patient had frequent ectopy over the pacer
and the Cardiology Team was consulted. With interrogation of the
pacer , they felt that she was having frequent infranodal ectopy ,
but the pacer itself with the AV function was functioning normally.
The AF suppression was temporarily turned off , which they felt may
stabilize the rate and decrease the amount of ectopy that was seen
on the monitor. Over the next several days , patient with the
amiodarone drip had better rate control , with suppression of also
the intrinsic A fib that she had preoperatively , and on post-op day
#3 was switched over to Lopressor from amiodarone , per
recommendation of Cardiology. Patient was extubated on post-op day
#1 and required heavy diuresis over the next several days to wean
off her O2 , but by day of discharge was weaned off O2. Chest x-ray
looked slightly wet , so patient will continue on diuresis at the
rehab center. The patient with improvement of her venous stasis
ulcers; however , they are still open , and with discussion with the
Cardiac Surgery chief fellow it was discussed that until they were
healed with new valves in place that they would like to continue
the triple antibiotics of vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl , and
will be discharged to the rehab with those antibiotics. The
levofloxacin and Flagyl can be as p.o. and vancomycin as IV. The
patient also had a PICC line placed for poor venous access , which
by x-ray was in good position and 43 cm in length.
The patient by post-op day #10 was in stable condition to be
transferred to the rehab facility , and will be discharged with the
following medications: Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.
constipation , Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. x 5 days and to reassess
further Lasix dosing , ibuprofen 200-800 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
pain , Levoxyl 50 mcg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Flagyl
500 mg p.o. t.i.d. until improvement of leg ulcer , Niferex 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Darvocet 100 one tablet q.6h. p.r.n. pain , Silvadene
1% topical b.i.d. to the venous stasis ulcer , vancomycin 1 g q.12h.
( hold for vancomycin trough &gt;15 ) , Coumadin , to check with hold q.d.
to target INR between 2 to 3 , Coumadin will be 5 mg dose tonight ,
K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. t.i.d. x 5 days while on the current Lasix
dosing , levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. once a day , and Carraklenz one
application topical b.i.d. as needed for dressing changes.
Patient to follow up with her cardiologist , Dr. Dominguez , phone
number 265-633-5715 , in 1-2 weeks; patient to follow up with Dr.
Golebiowski , 117-219-4079 , in 6 weeks for post surgical eval; and patient
to follow up with his Coumadin dosing with Dr. Cumberlander ,
telephone number 016-503-0251 , for further Coumadin dosing once
discharged from the rehab center.
