ADDENDUM: Please see prior dictation. This is an addendum to the
previous discharge summary dictated on 4/28/91 .
On postoperative day number five , as the patient was being prepared
for discharge to the Habra Raco Hospital , she spiked to 101.7 and then to
102.2. A complete fever workup was done which included negative
blood cultures , a urine culture positive for 10 , 000 Enterococci
consistent with a mild urinary tract infection. Of note , the
patient had no evidence of pyelonephritis without any CVA
tenderness. She had a chest x-ray performed which showed only
atelectasis. Careful examination of the lower extremity showed no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis. The most likely source of
fever in this morbidly obese woman was a wound infection. Thus ,
the patient's staples were removed , and the wound was carefully
examined. The following day , after heat had been applied to the
wound , one small area in the wound separated , and a seroma
containing some serosanguineous fluid was drained. The wound was
then deeply probed , and extended very deeply. The fascia was
completely intact. A Penrose drain was placed through the opening
in the incision to allow the serosa to completely drain. The
following day , on postoperative day number eight , the drain was
removed , and the wound was packed deeply with Nu-Gauze soaked in
half strength hydrogen peroxide. Wet-to-dry dressing changes were
performed for several days , and the wound continued to remain clean
with healthy appearing tissue. Wound culture revealed Staphylococcus
coagulase negative. She had been started on oral Ampicillin for enterococcal
UTI. The
patient became afebrile immediately after the wound drained and had no further
elevations in her temperature. A chest film showed only
atelectasis , and thus she was vigorously ambulated and received
more chest physical therapy , and Albuterol nebulized treatment. Of
note , the patient's white count rose to 16 with a fever again
probably associated with the patient's wound infection. The
patient is thus discharged home on 8/1/91 , postoperative day 12 in
stable condition. She will be followed very closely by the
Visiting Nurses Association with frequent dressing changes and
wound care. She will also be followed very closely by Dr. Kristin Due as an outpatient. The patient is thus discharged home in
stable condition , following a complication of her surgery , a wound
separation.
