BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: dyspnea , hypoxia
HPI: 73 yo Mwith CAD s/p multiple CABG and PCI , iCMP ( EF 25-30% ) ,
PVD , hyperlipidemia , and PAF on coumadin presents with acute
worsening of shortness of breath and cyanosis. He has had
progressively worsening dyspnea and weight gain over the past
several months. Dry weight 175 , now 181. He has stable orthopnea and
sleeps with his head raised to 30 degrees. Increasing abdominal
girth. Stable nocturia ( 1-2 times per night ). Dry persistent
cough for past several months. He complains of dry mouth and takes a
lot of ice chips. However , he does restrict his fluid intake to less
than 2 quarts daily. The am of admission , the patient was
acutely short of breath upon waking. He was noted to by cyanotic
( hands and face ) by his wife. He was given supplemental oxygen by his
wife , and his oxygen saturation was in the high 80s. He does not
use oxygen at baseline. He has baseline angina ( nonradiating
substerna chest pain relived by nitro spray ).

HOSPITAL COURSE
73 yo M with known CAD ( s/p multiple CABG and PCI ) , ischemic CMP ( EF
25-30% ) , hyperlipidemia , PVD , IDDM and worsening dyspnea presents with
acute shortness of breath and cyanosis.
1. CV/Pump: iCMP ( EF 25-30% ) NYHA class III. S/p ICD placement. Patient
with progressive volume overload uncontrolled as outpatient. Admitted
with acute decompensation with hypoxia and cyanosis. JVP elevated on
exam. Will diurese aggressively with goal of dry weight ( 175 pounds ). Not
currently on spironolactone or ACEI. The patient responded to diuresis
with lasix 60 mg IV BID. Weight on discharge down to goal of 175 pounds.
Starting a new afternoon sliding scale for diuretics. For each pound over
175 , he will take 20 mg lasix.
2. CV/Ischemia: known severe CAD s/p multiple CABG and PCI with stable
angina at baseline. Episode the morning of admission was his baseline
angina. However , Tn became elevated to 0.33 , but was downtrending. This
is likely demand in the setting of hypoxia/respiratory distress.
His ST depressions on admission were not much changed from baseline , and
resolved by the morning. His ASA and plavix was continued. He is
intolerant of statins.
3. CV/Rhythm: PAF on coumadin. Currently in NSR. Digoxin level 0.4.
4. Pulm: hypoxia likely due to pulmonary edema and worsening CHF. However
CXR with little evidence of edema. His saturation improved to 95% on RA
prior to discharge. He felt symptomatically better.
5. Renal: ARF with baseline Cr 1.2. Likely 2/2 DM. UA and urine
protein/creatinine pending on discharge
6. Heme: anticoagulation with coumadin for atrial fibrillation ( Goal INR
2.0 to 3.0 )
7. Vascular: PVD s/p revascularization. Magnesium for leg cramps.
8. FEN: low fat , low cholesterol , 2 gm sodium , 2L fluid restriction.
Replacing electrolytes aggressively. Has sliding scalre K replacement at
home.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to take your lasix and potassium on your sliding scale as you
were before admission.
Continue your original insulin sliding scale.
Weigh yourself daily.
Continue your original outpatient medications
***********
NEW AFTERNOON LASIX SCALE
Take your afternoon weight.
For every pound over 175 , take 20 mg lasix.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Monitor electrolytes while on lasix.
2. Monitor daily weights. Patient is on sliding scale diuretics.
3. Consider other options for lipid lowering ( ie ezetimibe ,
cholestryramine )
4. Consider tighter diabetes control as outpatient fingersticks are 80s
to 300s at home.
5. Consider adding back ACEI when tolerable
6. Consider spironolactone for class III CHF and for K retention.
7. Monitor INR and titrate coumadin
8. f/u HbA1c
