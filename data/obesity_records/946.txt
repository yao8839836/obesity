HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Nellum is a 60-year-old woman with
a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and congestive heart
failure who presented in February of 2001 with pain in the left
lateral aspect of her fifth metatarsophalangeal area without
bleeding. This wound has failed to heal over time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times
20 years , obesity , hypertension , depression ,
sleep apnea.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 8/23/94 incision and drainage and
debridement of abdominal wound. 4/6/94 ,
debridement of abdominal wound. 10/26/94 debridement and closure
of abdominal wound. 1/7/96 debridement of a chronically infected
abdominal wound in the right lower quadrant. 4/5/97 debridement
of nonhealing abdominal wound in the right lower quadrant. Ventral
hernia repair and abdominoplasty in 4/27/97. 8/1/97 drainage of
seroma with wound debridement and closure. The patient has also
had an appendectomy in 1994 , cholecystectomy and ventral hernia
repair.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 600 mg
p.o. q day , Prozac 40 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec
20 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day , Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q
day , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q day and magnesium supplementation of an
unknown quantity.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Weight 315 pounds , blood pressure 130/70 , pulse 68 ,
respiratory rate 18. GENERAL: She was an obese ,
age appropriate elderly female. HEENT: Extraocular movements
intact. No jugular venous distention and no bruits. HEART: With
a clear distinct S1 and S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs ,
rubs or gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation with no wheezes ,
rales or rhonchi. ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender , nondistended with
normal active bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES:
Demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. She had radial pulses
2 plus right and 2 plus at the left. Femoral pulses 1 plus
bilaterally. Popliteal pulses 1 plus bilaterally. Dorsalis pedis
pulse was biphasic and so was the posterior tibialis bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the manic vascular
surgery service and she underwent an
uncomplicated debridement of the nonhealing ulcer on the left
lateral aspect of her left forefoot. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was stable in the immediate postoperative
period. The patient was then transferred to the floor where she
underwent a rapid progressive and uncomplicated course of recovery.
The patient's hospital stay was protracted due to inability of the
patient to mobilize herself with the assistance of physical
therapy. She was screened for rehabilitation placement at this
time but there was some difficulty in placement secondary to bed
non-availability. This immobility is consistent with her
mobilization ambulatory capacity at home as per her own report.
The patient throughout the remainder of her hospital stay had
continued progressive healing of the wound on the lateral aspect of
her left forefoot with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Her finger
stick blood sugars were well controlled. By postoperative day
number seven , June , 2001 the patient was found to have
minimal pain , to be voiding and moving her bowels with ease , to be
ambulating with assistance from physical therapy and a walker , to
demonstrate continued well healing of the ulcer at the lateral
aspect of the left forefoot. She was satting well on room air and
tolerating a diabetic house diet.
A placement in a rehabilitation facility was found and the patient
was discharged to rehabilitation with appropriate follow up and
discharge instructions.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally with no wheezes , rales or
rhonchi. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , obese , nontender , nondistended. Normal
active bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Pulses at the foot which are
biphasic at the dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibialis
bilaterally. The ulcer at the lateral aspect of her left forefoot
was well healing and approximately 0.75 cm in diameter with a well
developed bed of granulation tissue.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4h p.r.n. pain ,
headaches or temperature greater than
101.0 , Prozac 40 mg q day , NPH insulin 60 units q a.m. and 40 units
q p.m. subcutaneously , insulin regular sliding scale subcutaneously

p.r.n. pain , Senna tablets p.o. b.i.d. , Trazodone 50 mg p.o.

Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day.
REMAINING ISSUES: Primarily mobilization. The patient should be
seen by physical therapy to expand her
ambulatory and mobilization capacity. Her wound should be cared
for with wet-to-dry dressing changes twice per day and she should
follow up with Dr. Loerwald in 7-10 days.
