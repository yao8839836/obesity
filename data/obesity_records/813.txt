BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
70 y/o man w/ CAD ( s/p CABGx2 , PCI in 8/17 ) , PVD ,
IDDM , afib , htn admitted for catheterization after abnl
dobutamine-MRI. Admitted in 8/17 with symptoms of angina and dyspnea
on exertion , cardiac MRI showed ischemia and pt underwent
cath w/ LMCA and SBG to RtPDA stented. On discharge
no longer had angina but increased
pulmonary congestion and cough. Moderate improvement
with increased lasix. On 6/5/03 had
elective dobutamine-MRI which led to angina and
reversible ischemia in RCA/LCx territory. Plan was to
cath but elevated INR and rhonchorous. Admit to
diurese and reverse
anticoagulation. Exam: rhonchi throughout both
lung fields , bilateral carotid bruits ,
S1+S2+S3 ( visible +
audible ) , protuberant abdomen , left femoral bruit ,
faint left dp pulse; nonpalpable r dp pulse.
Ext lukewarm.
*****************************************
Ischemic heart disease. We continued ASA , bb , wellchol , ace. Held
coumadin prior to LHC as supratherapeutic ( afib ); gave 1mg vit K.
Catheterization revealed no change from prior with patent LM stent and
stent within SVG to PLV graft. Concluded that symptoms likely due to
CHF. Will have future stress-imaging study to correlate.
CHF: Diuresed w/ home lasix + lasix IV. PCWP 26 suggesting increasing
diuretic regimen advisable. Rhonchi decreased considerably with
diuresis.
DM: A humalog scale +lantus combination was used effectively for
glycemic control.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please contact PCP if shortness of breath , weight gain &gt;3lb , chest
pain. Monitor your diet to avoid salty foods and too much fluid.
Please work with your doctor to develop ideal diuretic regimen.
