HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 60-year-old female with a history of chronic venous
stasis ulcers of bilateral lower extremities admitted to the Plastic
Surgery service with infection on 11/9/05 .  The patient was
treated with IV vancomycin and levofloxacin and the patient has
been afebrile during the stay. She has been getting dressing
changes with acetic acid solution three times a day on her lower
extremity ulcers bilaterally. Over the course of the days the
ulcer looks pretty clean and very nice and she has been doing
very good. Her pain is well controlled and she has been treated
with the bed rest , IV antibiotics , and the dressing changes. She
has been told to keep her legs elevated most of the time , so that
the swelling will decrease , and the patient has been afebrile
with the stabe vital signs. She has been taking p.o. and been
voiding. She has been ambulating independently from bed to bath
and chair and her pain has been well controlled. The lower
extremity wounds are getting well and there is no evidence of any
purulent discharge or evidence of infection. While the patient
was here , her vancomycin and levofloxacin have been discontinued
and the patient is switched to Bactrim double strength as the
wound culture revealed Achromobacter and xylosoxidans , which was
sensitive. The patient will be discharged to home today with the
