9.2 , phos 2.0. Chest x-ray no infiltrate. EKG normal sinus
rhythm , no ST segment changes , left axis deviation and LVH , no
pacemaker spikes noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE/ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. ID - Candida non-albicans
grew out of his cultures from
his hemodialysis center. He was started on amphotericin-B with an
ID consult , and will complete a four week course on 2/18/03. His
cultures here at the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of remain negative. They removed his
infected pacemaker , as well as his Hickman catheter. He has been
afebrile here for the last several weeks , 2-3 weeks prior to
discharge.
2. Cardiovascular - ( A ) Rhythm - His pacemaker was removed. It
had been interrogated not long prior to his admission here and had
not been firing , and therefore , did not appear to be needed anyway.
He had to return to the EP lab a second time for a lead extraction ,
as they were unable to pull out the leads on the first attempt. By
his repeat echoes , however , he appears to have a retained pacemaker
wire although EP believes that they removed the entire wire for all
intents and purposes. It should be assumed that he does have a
retained wire , however. Also , the patient had episodes of atrial
flutter with rapid ventricular response and a decreased blood
pressure after his pacemaker was removed. He was ultimately
treated with amiodarone with excellent control over his weight and
rhythm , and has been in normal sinus rhythm for the last week or so
prior to discharge. There are no plans for pacemaker placement at
this time. ( B ) Ischemia - He complained of chest pain while he was
here and ruled out for a MI. ( C ) Pump - Hypertensive while in
atrial flutter and then again during an episode of acute blood
loss. Since both issues have resolved , his blood pressures have
been very stable. He is to be continued on his Vasotec and
Lopressor. ( D ) Vascular - He had a traumatic left groin line
attempt. Vascular , subsequently , performed a groin exploration ,
hematoma evacuation , and sutured his vascular laceration. The
patient continued to lose a significant amount of blood into his
thigh , requiring several units of blood and one unit of platelets.
His hematocrit , however , has now been stable for one week prior to
discharge. He has a follow-up appointment with vascular on
11/20/03.
3. FEN/GU - Hemodialysis patent , very poor access. After removal
of his possibly infected hemodialysis catheter , IR was completely
unable to place an IJ or subclavian catheter on either side.
Ultimately , they had to place a tunnelled right groin line which is
very poor long-term option. He has a followup in vascular clinic with Dr Loerwald
on 11/10/03 to address his access issue , for possible creatine of a groin
AVfistula or graft.
4. Heme - Hematocrit now stable , high 20s , low 30s. B12 and
folate are normal.
5. Disposition - The patient is to be discharged to rehab on
10/11/03 in stable condition. He has become very deconditioned
while he was here in the hospital as he was unable to get much PT
here given both his groin hematoma and some of his groin access
issues. Now there are no restrictions on his activity as his right
groin line is tunnelled.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache ,
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. , amphotericin
125 mg IV q.24h. to be given with 100 mg of hydrocortisone IV prior
to his amphotericin , also should be treated with 1 mg IV of
morphine prior to his amphotericin administration , Phoslo 2 tabs
p.o. q.a.c. and q.h.s. , Cepacol 1-2 lozenges p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
throat pain , Cepacol 1 lozenge p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Vasotec 40 mg p.o. q.d. , hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q.d. ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Percocet 1 tab p.o. q.6h. , low dose
because he is a hemodialysis patient , Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Risperdal 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Nephrocaps 1 tab p.o. q.d. , calcium
carbonate plus vitamin D 2 tabs p.o. b.i.d. away from meals , Nexium
40 mg p.o. q.d. , ondansetron 4 mg IV p.r.n. emesis.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: ( 1 ) Include 11/10/03 at 1:15 p.m. with
Dr. Loerwald , vascular surgery clinic at the
I Warho Hospital . This is for both a left postop groin
check , as well as to address his access problems. ( 2 ) He has
hemodialysis three times a week.
