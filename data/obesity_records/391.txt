cardiac catheterization to fix any blockages that may be in your heart
arteries supplying your heart , we have treated you with medicines. Your
blood pressure was high in the hospital , so we've started you on a
medicine HCTZ , and also an antibiotic , levofloxacin , for a urinary

Mclaird in 1-2 wks , and a cardiologist in 2-4 wks. Call if you have
