ATTENDING: GUMINA , MARJORY SHELA MD
SERVICE:
Aga Fay Hamp
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
Rufus Bernas , M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Aspiration pneumonia.
ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS:
Thalamic stroke , left hemiparesis , hypertension , diabetes ,
expressive aphasia status post VP shunt.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of a recent right
hemorrhagic stroke in 8/21 now with minimal purposeful activity
who follows simple commands and lives in a nursing home who
presents with a likely aspiration pneumonia. He was noted to be
hypoxic after a vomiting episode at his nursing home. He was
unable to provide a history but the events were recounted by the
nursing home staff. On 10/9/05 , he had fevers to 101.5 and
congestion throughout the day despite getting nebs and oxygen ,
his condition did not improve , he vomited twice and was noted to
be hypoxic to an oxygen saturation of 84% on 5 liters of O2 , he
also had a temperature of 101.6 , a heart rate of 127 , a blood
pressure of 140/80 and was sent to the Pagham University Of Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department , the
patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 102.6 , heart rate
of 133 , respiratory rate of 24 , blood pressure 155/72 and 93%
oxygen saturation on nasal cannula. His EKG initially showed ST
elevations inferiorly. He was evaluated by Cardiology who felt
that given his comorbidities and poor functional status he was
not a candidate for cardiac catheterization. His EKGs
spontaneously normalized without intervention. His first set of
cardiac enzymes was negative. His chest x-ray showed a
left-sided pneumonia and he had a white blood cell count of 34.
He received 2 liters of normal saline , cefotaxime , and Flagyl.
He also received Lopressor and aspirin. Of note , the patient had
been given Flagyl in the nursing home , which was started on
10/4/05.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Of note , the patient had a recent medical history significant for
a right thalamic hemorrhagic stroke , which resulted in left
hemiparesis on an admission 7/14/05 to 1/29/05 during which a
VP shunt was placed that hospitalization was complicated by an
aspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted on 2/6/05 to 10/21/05
for a change in mental status during which he was given
antibiotics on and off for the VP shunt. He resolved during this
hospitalization to baseline and was discharged to the nursing
home. Past medical history is also significant for history of
aspiration pneumonia status post a PEG tube 10/27 , diabetes ,
hypertension , aortic stenosis , colon cancer and spinal fusion in
2002.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Clonidine 0.2 q.a.m. , 0.4 q.p.m. , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d. , HCTZ 25
daily , Lantus 70 , lisinopril 40 daily , Norvasc 10 daily , Keppra
1000 at bedtime , terazosin 2 at bedtime , omeprazole 20 daily ,
Jevity 1.2 at 90 mL per hour with free water bolus of 240 mL
q.i.d. , Colace , Senna , MVI.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He lives alone , no smoking , no alcohol by report. Currently
lives a Wa Van
LABORATORY DATA:
Labs on admission were significant for a white count of 36 ,
hematocrit 45 , platelets of 327 , 000 , creatinine of 1.2 up from
baseline of 0.7 , remainder of his Chem-7 was normal. His cardiac
enzymes on admission showed a CK of 79 , CK-MB of 1.3 and troponin
less than assay. His UA was negative. Chest x-ray showed left
mid lung hazy opacity. Abdomen and pelvis CT showed no acute
processes. Head CT showed a right VP shunt and no acute changes.
EKG as described above.
CONSULTANTS DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:
Included Cardiology for question of cardiac catheterization as
described above.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pneumonia: The patient was thought to have a likely
aspiration pneumonia despite his PEG tube because of reported
vomiting at the nursing home. He was put on broad antibiotic
coverage of vancomycin , ceftazidime , and Flagyl. He was
continued on a 14-day course of antibiotics with clinical
improvement. His antibiotics were discontinued after 14 days and
he remained afebrile with the normal white count. Of note , on
2/16/05 , he had another episode of vomiting , which was thought
to result in another aspiration event. However , repeat chest
x-rays showed no additional pneumonia and given that he was
treated with a full two-week course of antibiotics it was decided
to end his course of antibiotics and he remained afebrile with a
normal white blood cell count.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient initially had ST elevations
normalized. This was thought likely to be due to demand ischemia
given its complete resolution. Per Cardiology recommendations ,
he was not a candidate for long-term anticoagulation or cardiac
catheterization. He was continued on medical management without
further incident.
3. Hypertension: The patient was persistently hypertensive and
his blood pressure medications were titrated up and additional
medications were added as described in discharge medication list.
4. Diabetes: The patient's insulin regimen was titrated up to
cover persistently high morning blood sugars given tube feeds
overnight.
5. Neurological: The patient had a baseline aphasia and was
difficult to communicate with , however , as his pneumonia
resolved , his mental status improved and he was able to
communicate with short phrases and answer yes or no questions.
6. FEN: He was receiving tube feeds overnight per Nutrition
recommendations. He was also receiving NPH and regular insulin
as described in discharge medications.
7. C. difficile: The patient had some diarrhea and was tested
for C. diff. This returned positive and he was continued on
Flagyl for a total of 3-4-week course as determined by the rehab
facility.
CODE STATUS:
Full code.
Because of difficulty communication with the patient , it was
unclear what his exact code status was so he remained full code.
His mother is his next of kin but due to her own medical problems
and a recent hospitalization , she was unreachable and it was
unclear whether she had capacity for decision making. There was
an ethics consult meeting on 4/4/05 to determine the goals of
care. Per discussion at that meeting which is documented in the
medical chart , It was decided that he remain full code. This
will need to be readdressed with Mr. Josic at some point when it
can be determined if he is competent for making this decision.
Please see the chart for further details on the results of this
ethics consult. Further questions regarding this can be
addressed to Dr. Gumina , the attending physician.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:

yes or no with occasional short phrases. A 3/6 holosystolic
