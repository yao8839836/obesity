Discharge Date: 1/18/2007
ATTENDING: ISA , KAM MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pneumonia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: An 86-year-old female with past
medical history significant for atrial fibrillation , diastolic
CHF , rheumatic heart disease status post mitral valve
replacement and tricuspid repair , chronic renal insufficiency , prior small-bowel
obstruction and GI bleeding who presented with abdominal pain.
The patient reports sudden onset of abdominal pain approximately
one day prior to admission , which became progressively worse.
The patient was noted to have nausea and vomiting at home with
green/yellow fluid. The patient was suspected to have an
aspiration event per the patient's daughter. The patient denies
fever or chills. Denies dysuria. Denies shortness of breath or
cough. No recent antibiotics. No sick contacts.
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Temperature 97.5 , heart rate 74 ,
blood pressure 183/65 improved to 128/56 , respiratory rate 16 ,
oxygen saturation 96% on room air , subsequently decreased to 92%
on room air and improved to 96% on 2 L nasal cannula. On exam ,
patient was noted to have positive jugular venous distension , 3/6
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border , right lower
quadrant tenderness to palpation , abdomen soft and without
rebound tenderness. A chest x-ray was performed and a right
lower lobe infiltrate and moderate pulmonary edema was noted. A
KUB was also performed , which did not show any evidence of
obstruction. An abdominal CT demonstrated mild diffuse small
bowel thickening concerning for infection versus ischemia. The
patient was given ceftriaxone , azithromycin and Flagyl IV as well
as Lasix 40 mg IV x1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin , rheumatic heart disease status post bioprosthetic
mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair ( 2000 ) , mild

CONSULTING SERVICES:

2. Surgery.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Abdominal pain: Unclear etiology of abdominal pain on
presentation , but given history of mesenteric ischemia and
questionable small-bowel thickening on CT , the initial concern
GI and Surgical Services were consulted and followed the patient over
Hospital day #1. Serial CBC , lactate and anion gaps were
followed and showed no evidence of ischemia. By the evening of
hospital day #1 , the patient's abdominal pain had fully resolved
and the patient was initiated on clears. By the morning of
hospital day #2 , the patient was tolerating a regular diet.
Although no clear diagnosis could be made , the rapid resolution
of the patient's abdominal pain was thought to be most consistent
with viral enteritis. Given the patient's history of
atherosclerosis , further imaging of the abdominal vessels by MRA
during followup was recommended by the GI Service.
2. Pneumonia: Bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspiration
pneumonia. The patient was initially treated empirically with
ceftriaxone , azithromycin and Flagyl IV , which was switched to
cefpodoxime plus Flagyl p.o. on hospital day #2. The patient
became febrile on HD#4 ( 3/7/07 ) up to 101.9 and as such was switched
back to ceftriaxone , Flagyl and azithromycin IV after
which the patient remained afebrile throughout the remainder of
her admission. The patient was discharged on 10/25/07 with
instructions to complete an additional six days of cefpodoxime ,
Flagyl and azithromycin p.o. for a total of 14 days of antibiotic
therapy. The patient was also given lactobacillus as a probiotic
agent.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient was noted in the ED to have a mild
oxygen requirement with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air ,
which improved to 97% on 2 L nasal cannula. The differential
diagnosis for the patient's hypoxemia included pulmonary edema
( seen on chest x-ray ) and pneumonia. The patient was given 40 mg
IV Lasix in the Emergency Department and was treated for
pneumonia as above. On Hospital day #2 , the patient's at rest
room air oxygen saturation was noted to be 95-97% , but decreased
to 85% with ambulation on room air. The patient was still
thought to be mildly hypervolemic and was gently diuresed. On
the day of discharge , the patient was noted to have a room air
saturation of 100% at rest and 95% with ambulation. The patient
was instructed to continue gentle oral diuresis at home and VNA
services were arranged to monitor her oxygen saturations and daily weight.
4. Anemia: History of GI bleeding , chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient's hematocrit was stable at baseline 33-36 throughout
her hospital admission. The patient was guaiac negative on
admission. An active type and screen was maintained throughout
admission. No evidence of GI bleeding throughout
hospitalization. The patient's hematocrit was 37.7 on admission
and 33.5 at discharge. The patient was given her weekly Procrit
5000 units subcutaneous injection on 10/25/07 prior to discharge.
The patient was instructed to resume iron supplementation after
discharge.
5. CHF: The patient's admission chest x-ray was suggestive of
pulmonary edema , possibly secondary to elevated blood pressure in
the setting of abdominal pain versus insufficient diuresis at
home. There was no evidence of acute ischemia on EKG. The
patient was gently diuresed during her admission. The patient's
dry weight is 57 kg. The patient's weight at discharge was 61
kg. Repeat chest x-ray on the morning of discharge still showed
evidence of pulmonary congestion and interstitial edema. As
such , the patient was thought to be still mildly hypervolemic at
the time of her discharge and was instructed to continue gentle
diuresis at home. The patient was discharged on Lasix 80 mg p.o.
twice daily , which is a slight increase from her home dose of 80
mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. The patient was instructed to measure
her weights daily and to follow up with her cardiologist , Dr.
Meduna , for further titration of her diuretic dose.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was elevated in
the ED up to 183/65 in the setting of abdominal pain and improved
over several hours to the 110-120s/60s-70s. On hospital day #2 ,
the patient's blood pressure was noted to be slightly elevated
from 130s-150s/70s. As such , the patient's valsartan and Norvasc
were restarted on hospital day #2. The patient's Imdur was
restarted on hospital day #4. The patient's blood pressure
remained well controlled during the remainder of her admission
ranging from 100-122/46-71 on her home regimen.
7. Atrial fibrillation: With pseudoregularization. The
patient's rate was noted to be well controlled. The patient's
Coumadin was held in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR likely
secondary to concurrent antibiotic use. The
patient's INR trended down to 2.1 on hospital day #4 and she was
restarted on a reduced dose of Coumadin. The patient's INR was
2.7 on the a.m. of discharge on Coumadin 1 mg nightly while still
on antibiotics as above. VNA Services were arranged to measure
her INR on 7/11/07 and to send the results to the PUO Coumadin Clinic ,
132-202-5576.
7. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine was
noted to be at baseline 2.7 on admission and slightly
increased creatinine to 3.2 at the time of discharge. In
contrast , the patient's BUN was 83 at discharge , down from 111 on
admission. The patient did not show evidence of contraction
alkalosis with bicarbonate=22 on a.m. of discharge. The
patient's BUN , creatinine and bicarbonate were to be rechecked on
7/11/07 with the results sent to Dr Meduna ( Cardiology ) and
Dr. Norseth ( nephrology ) for further titration of her medications
as needed.
8. Diabetes: The patient was initially continued on home dose
Lantus and sliding scale insulin. Standing NovoLog insulin
q.a.c. was reinitiated as the patient's p.o. intake improved.
The patient's Lantus dose was titrated up to improve glucose
control during admission. However , the patient experienced
intermittent hypoglycemia at increased doses of Lantus and was
returned to her home dose of 8 units subcu nightly. At the time
of discharge , the patient was returned to her home insulin
regimen of Lantus 8 units nightly plus NovoLog 4 units with
breakfast , 4 units with lunch and 5 units with dinner plus
sliding scale insulin. The patient was instructed to continue to
monitor her blood glucose with meals.
