Echocardiogram 9/25/07
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: seizures , hypoxemia
HPI: 53F h/o sarcoid , seizure disorder within the last year , possible
cardiomyopathy , asthma , smoking , HTN , and obesity p/w seizure activity
at home and then later in the ED. Has a history of intermittent
non-adherence to prescribed dilantin regimen. Treated acutely with
ativan , found to be subtherapeutic on dilantin so re-loaded with
dilantin to achieve therapeutic levels. Observed in ED overnight with
plans for morning discharge , but became questionably hypoxemic ( O2 sat
low 90s ) and somewhat subjectively dyspneic. The physicians in the
emergency room thought that the patient was having
an asthma exacerbation and gave the patient prednisone 60mg x 1 ,
combivent/albuterol nebulizer treatment , levofloxacin/clindamycin
for possible aspiration pneumonia , and admitted her to the medical floor
for further evaluation and treatment.
Hospital Course:
1 ) Pulmonary. On admission to the floor , the patient was found to have
normal oxygen saturations in the mid 90s on room air and was not thought to
have any concurrent bronchospasm or focal sounds of a pneumonia. Her chest
x ray was negative , she was not having fevers and her white blood count was
normal. Her steroids and levofloxacin/clindamycin were therefore
discontinued and she received her home inhalers and nebulizers only. She
remained stable on this regimen throughout her hospital stay. Her breath
sounds and heart sounds were admittedly a bit distant and she may have an
element of undiagnosed COPD , so pulmonary function tests were recommended
as an outpatient. Additionally , the patient may benefit from a sleep study
as an outpatient given her component of desaturation while asymptomatic and
sleeping during the night of admission.
2 ) Infectious disease. The patient did have an apparent urinary tract
infection and so was treated with ciprofloxacin 250mg twice daily for three
days.
3 ) Cardiovascular. The pt did report some symptoms of PND and orthopnea ,
which appeared to be stable for the last several years. She was not volume
overloaded on exam. She received an echocardiogram to investigate possible
cardiomyopathy or congestive failure , and this showed a normal ejection
fraction without obvious structural abnormalities except for mild bilateral
atrial dilatation.
4 ) Neurological. The inpatient medical team communicated with the pts
outpatient neurologist to discuss continued seizures in the context of
questionable intermittent noncompliance. Per the instructions of her
neurologist , the pts dilantin was increased to 230mg PO QAM and 200mg PO
QPM with plans to check another dilantin level on Friday March ( five
days after increasing dose ). Her neurontin dose was also increased to 600mg
three times daily.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 ) Please draw dilantin level on Friday 4/3/07 and send results to
outpatient primary care physician and outpatient neurologist.
2 ) Please help pt with medication teaching , especially as regards
anti-epileptics ( dilantin , neurontin ) in order to improve outpt
compliance and reduce frequency of seizures.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 ) Please follow up dilantin level to be drawn by VNA on Friday 10/21/07.
2 ) Consider PFTs/sleep study as outpt.
