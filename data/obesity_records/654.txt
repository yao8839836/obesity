ATTENDING: DEPSKY , GWYNETH MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Urosepsis.
LIST OF PROBLEMS:
1. Urosepsis.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia.
4. Aspiration.
5. Pulmonary embolism.
6. Diabetes.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Spinal sarcoidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of spinal
sarcoidosis with secondary paraplegia who presented with altered
mental status , hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. He
was doing well until the morning of 4/29/2006 when he complained
of difficulty breathing and his wife placed him on home CPAP
machine that he usually uses at night. Despite being placed on
the machine , he was still having air hunger and complaining of
feeling unwell. His wife also noted him to have increasing
lethargy and decreased responsiveness and called EMS to have him
brought to the emergency room. He also was noted to have a
decreased urine output from his chronic suprapubic catheter x2
days. In the emergency room , he was found to be unresponsive ,
grunting , and in respiratory distress. His initial room air
saturation was in the high 60's to low 70's. He was placed on
100% nonrebreather with some improvement of his saturations in
the low 90's and an ABG of 7.37/43/77 on 100% nonrebreather. He
was therefore intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. He
became hypotensive with intubation despite using etomidate with
blood pressures in the 60's/40's , and an initial CVP of 16 , so he
was started on Levophed with a systolic blood pressure in the
130's on 7 to 10 of Levophed. He received 1 liter of IV fluid.
He received a head CT without contrast that showed no acute
bleeding or acute infarction. He had a chest x-ray that showed
no obvious infiltrate. His INR was found to be elevated. Given
the CT of his abdomen without contrast that showed a suprapubic
catheter obstruction with bilateral hydronephrosis and distended
bladder. His creatinine was 2.9 , elevated from his baseline of
0.9. Urology was consulted to change the suprapubic catheter
tube and pus was noted to be aspirated from the suprapubic
catheter. He was started on vancomycin , gentamicin , Flagyl , and
stress dose steroids , and blood and urine cultures were sent in
the emergency and he was transferred to the MICU.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Sarcoid disease 20 years ago , paraplegia x18 years , chronic
suprapubic catheter/ostomy for 12 years , diabetes type II , right
DVT , on Coumadin , status post chronic UTI , and CPAP at night for
obstructive sleep apnea.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Include Regular Insulin sliding scale a.c. and at bedtime , NPH 54
units in the morning and 68 units in the night , baclofen 10 mg
t.i.d. , amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime , oxybutynin 5 mg t.i.d. ,
gabapentin 300 mg t.i.d. , iron sulfate 325 mg t.i.d. , vitamin C
500 mg daily , magnesium 420 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg daily ,
ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. , and calcium 950 mg daily.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 97.4 , heart rate 105 , blood pressure 136/67 ,
his O2 saturation was 100% on AC 700 with PEEP of 5. In general ,
he was intubated and responsive to simple commands. HEENT:
Sluggish pupils. His lungs were clear anteriorly. His heart was
in regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. His
abdomen was obese , large , soft , nondistended and nontender , with
positive bowel sounds. His extremities had chronic venous stasis
changes of right and lower extremities with areas of no skin
breakdown. He had a large sacral decubitus ulcer with bone
exposed that was foul smelling on his sacrum. He was
neurologically moving all four extremities and following
commands. He had an ostomy and suprapubic catheter in place.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Notable for an elevated creatinine of 2.9 , otherwise , his Chem-7
was within normal limits. His LFTs were within normal limits.
His hematocrit was 34.6 , his white count was 9.4 , and his
platelets were 343 , 000. He had negative cardiac enzymes. His
urine and blood tox screens were negative. His UA was
significant for 3+ protein , trace glucose , negative ketones , 3+
leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4-10 red blood cells , 4+
bacteria , and 3+ triple phosphate crystals. His EKG was in
normal sinus rhythm with an old right bundle-branch block and
left axis deviation , first-degree AV block. His chest x-ray
showed retrocardiac opacity that was thought to be aspiration
versus pneumonia. Abdominal and chest CT showed bibasilar
airspace opacities , left greater than right , with aspiration
versus pneumonia , bilateral hydronephrosis , severe decubitus
ulcers , and large gastrohepatic lymph nodes slightly enlarged and
calcified.
ASSESSMENT:
This is a 66-year-old man with spinal sarcoidosis and secondary
paraplegia , who presented with altered mental status , hypoxemic
respiratory failure , and hypotension , who had urosepsis and
pneumonia and found later on admission to have pulmonary
embolism.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Hypoxemia: He was intubated at the time of admission and
extubated a day later on 5/7/2006. BiPAP was used at night as
he had used at home for a sleep apnea with O2 saturations in the
high 90's on room air during the day. He was initially treated
for pneumonia with ceftazidime , levofloxacin , and vancomycin.
The vancomycin was discontinued on 3/18/2006 , and the
ceftazidime was discontinued on 10/8/206. His levofloxacin was
continued at 500 mg per day for a total 10-day course on
5/3/2006. This is to be used for a UTI and pneumonia. On
11/8/2006 , the patient was supposed to go home and found to have
a desaturation to high 80's on room air. He was found to have a
chest x-ray within normal limits. A pulmonary embolism CT was
done that demonstrated a small nonocclusive pulmonary embolism in
the posterobasilar segment of the right lower lobe with involving
right lower lobe infarct suggestive that he had had a PE that was
resolving. At this time , his INR had been subtherapeutic for
three days at 1.7 to 1.9 and he was continued on his Coumadin.
The following day , his INR was therapeutic at 2 , and on the day
of discharge , it was 2.2. It was thought that the PE was in the
setting of a subtherapeutic INR. His oxygen requirement was back
to baseline at the time of discharge , and his goal INR was to be
on the higher end of the 2 to 3 range , which was goal previously.
He was also given nebulizer treatments throughout his
hospitalization.
2. ID: His urine was found to have Proteus , resistant to
Macrobid , and Klebsiella , resistant to ampicillin. Levofloxacin
was started for this and for the presumed pneumonia seen on chest
x-ray for a total of a 10-day course. Sputum and blood cultures
have been no growth to date. He had no fevers and no elevated
white counts.
3. Cardiac: He was thought to have an element of autonomic
insufficiency secondary to sarcoid with episodes of hypo and
hypertension in the MICU. His cortisol stim test was within
normal limits , it was 14.5 before stim and 23.6 after stim , so he
was not treated with steroids. His blood pressure was in the
30's to 160's with pauses in the 100's on the floor with frequent
bigeminy and trigeminy and many PVCs , so he was started on 12.5
b.i.d. metoprolol on 7/6/2006 with good results. He continued
to have ectopy and continued to be hypertensive , and given his
diabetes , he was started on a low dose of captopril on 6/20/2006
with no complications and was able to maintain blood pressures in
ideal ranges.
4. GU: Urology replaces suprapubic catheter early on admission.
He was continued to have bladder irrigation with good effect ,
and Urology signed off on 7/13/2007.
5. Endocrine: The patient was given NPH 20 b.i.d. through his
hospitalization and Regular Insulin sliding scale. His sugars
were high on this reduced regimen and so he was placed on his
home NPH doses for discharge.
6. Decubitus ulcer: Plastic Surgery was consulted on 4/29/2006
and the wound did not look infected. It was debrided and
wet-to-dry t.i.d. dressing changes were recommended as well as
Panafil t.i.d. dressing changes. He was prescribed Panafil to go
home on.
7. Renal: The creatinine was initially 2.7 , and after receiving
IV fluids , it came down to 1.2. He likely had acute renal
failure secondary to postrenal obstructive etiology. His
creatinine was stable at around 1 for the remainder of his
admission.
8. Heme: The patient has a history of DVT. Initially , his INR
was found to be therapeutic and he was placed on levofloxacin , so
the plan was that he should have half of his home Coumadin dose
while he was on levofloxacin , so he was given half of dose and
his INRs came down to a nadir of 1.7. His INR was subtherapeutic
for three days , and at that time , a PE was found , his INR was
1.8. The day after this , his INR was 2 and then came up to 2.2
on the day of discharge. He was discharged on Coumadin 5 mg ,
which is his home dose to follow up at his Coumadin Clinic.
9. FEN: He was placed on maintenance IV fluids until cleared to
eat by Speech and Swallow. Speech and Swallow estimates having
baseline aspiration risk and he was known to cough and aspirate
at home. He had been recently worked up at the Landhi Terblack Ebro Medical Center
on a recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. They recommended
thickened puree diets and felt that even this he was likely to
aspirate. The risks and benefits of eating were explained to his
wife and him and he decided to continue to eat as there was no
ideal option.
10. Pain: He continued gabapentin , oxybutynin , and
amitriptyline as at home.
11. Prophylaxis: He was given Nexium and Coumadin.
12. Code status: He was full code , which was discussed with his
wife.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
The current temperature was 98 , the heart rate was 91 to 114 ,
blood pressure 100-114/54-70 , respiratory rate of 20 , and
saturating 97-100% on 1-2 liters. In general , he was responsive ,
alert , and appropriate. His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. His heart had normal S1 and S2 , soft systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. His abdomen
had positive bowel sounds , distended , soft and nontender. He had
a suprapubic catheter as well as an ostomy that were clean , dry
and intact. Extremities , he had 2+ peripheral edema that was
stable with no skin breakdown.
LABORATORY VALUES:
His labs at the time of discharge were stable. His hematocrit
was 27.2 , down from 29 , which was closed to his baseline of 34.
His INR was 2.1 at the time discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. at bedtime , vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily ,
baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Caltrate 600 Plus D one tablet p.o.
b.i.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , gabapentin 300 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , NPH human insulin 54 units in the morning , 68 units
in the evening , Regular Insulin sliding scale , levofloxacin 500
mg p.o. daily , to end on 11/23/2006 for a total course of 10
days , magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Panafil ointment t.i.d. ,
ranitidine 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily.
FOLLOW UP:
The patient will follow up his PCP , Dr. Whitmore The appointment
with Dr. Wildt will be within the next week , and the
appointment with the Coumadin Clinic will be tomorrow or the next
day.
ISSUES FOR FOLLOW UP:
Include following up on his aspiration risk and continuing to
discourage thin liquids as well as encourage him sitting upright
when eating and being observed and stopping when he coughs. He
will need continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoring
given the new beta-blocker and the ACE inhibitor as well as
assessment of his frequent PVCs. We will continue to follow his
diabetes and continue to follow his INR with a goal being 2 to 3
with ideal goal on the higher end 8 range.
