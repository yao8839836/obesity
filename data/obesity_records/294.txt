BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: New Atrial Flutter
-----
HPI: 58F with h/o colon CA s/p partial colectomy and 5FU/Leucovorin ,
hypothyroid p/w new a. flutter during pre-op eval for TKR scheduled
for DOA. Pt had no symptoms , no palps , no awareness of flutter. No
CP , no SOB , no acute diaphoresis , +stable DOE x years , no N/V/LH. Also
notes L&gt;R leg swelling after plane ride from New Wark Ro 2 days PTA , and
reports that she has long periods of inactivity due to severe knee pain.
+extensive diaphoresis and dyspnea with exertion particularly noticeable
since hip replacement surgery in August 2005. No wt loss , tremor , rash , joint
pain , hair changes , difficulties swallowing , changes in appetite or sleep.
TSH WNL in 9/19 .  In ED had mildly elevated d-dimer ( 541 ) , ECG with
persistent A flutter in 130s , given 40 IV dilt , 60 PO dilt , and PECT with
mistimed dye so unable to determine if PE. BPs stable throughout.
-----
PMH: OA , hypothyroid , colon CA ( s/p curative resection with
5FU/leucovorin chemo ) , s/p B THR , h/o bladder extension
MEDS: no regular medications , was supposed to be on lasix , lipitor ,
synthroid , but self-d/c'd; takes percocet for knee pain
ALL: NKDA
-----
INITIAL ASSESSMENT: 97.0 102 ( to 130s in ED ) 108/70 20 97%RA
A&amp;Ox3 , NAD , comfortable. No thyromegaly/nodules. Regular ,
tachy , nl S1S2 no murmurs , distant heart sounds. CTAB. Abd benign ,
trace LEE , 2+DP.
Labs notable for D-dimer 540 , Cr. 0.7 , negative enzymes.
EKG: A. flutter with 2:1 block at 150 , no clear ST-T abnormalities , nl
axis. CXR: no acute process. LENI: no clot above the knees bilaterally.
PECT: mistimed dye , nothing remarkable
-----
HOSPITAL COURSE:
CV-I: 2 negative sets of enzymes on admission. Given persistent exertional
dyspnea , the patient had a Myocardial PET on 10/19/06 revealing
mild-to-moderate basal inferior and inferior septal wall defects ( fully
reversible ). Concern for stable angina -- started ASA 81mg PO QD , Zocor
20mg PO QHS ( LDL 98 , HDL 59 ). Cardiac cathetherization on 3/6/06
revealed 95% Marg 1 ( ostial ) lesion that was opened with a TAXUS
stent. PATIENT NEEDS ASA INDEFINITELY AND PLAVIX FOR AT LEAST 3
MONTHS.
CV-P: TTE revealed mild posterior wall thickening , slightly
decreased LV function ( EF 45% ) , no significant AI , mild TR , mild RVH , no
obvious LAE , and no classic signs of RV response to increased afterload
( eg. PE ).
CV-R: New A. flutter , possible triggers include PE , ischemia ,
hyperthyroid. Rate controlled on Diltiazem 60mg PO Q6H and Lopressor
12.5mg PO Q8H. Will change to Diltiazem ER 240mg PO QD and Toprol XL 50mg
PO QD. Need to anticoagulate x 1 month prior decision regarding benefit of
cardioversion. Patient will be discharged on Coumadin 5mg PO QHS ( to be
followed by Coumadin Clinic ).
PULM: Moderate suspicion PE ( high until LENI negative ). Repeat PECT
on 10/3/06 revealed no evidence of PE. Good room air O2 sats at the
time of discharge.
ENDO: TSH 5.365 ( 0.5-5 ) , T4 5.8 ( 5-11 ) , Free T4 0.9 ( 0.8-1.8 ) --
borderline hypothyroidism. Cortisol 14.5.
HEME: Restarting Coumadin 5mg PO QHS at the time of discharge ( held for
cardiac cath ). Patient needs to have INR checked by VNA in 3 days ( INR
Goal 2-3 ).
RENAL: Mucomyst started given double dye load , gentle IVF. Cr 0.8 at the
time of discharge.
GI: H/o colon CA s/p chemo , resection. Stable. No acute issues.
MS: Eager for TKR -- on hold in the setting of plavix , anticoagulation
for atrial flutter. Prn oxycodone , tylenol.
