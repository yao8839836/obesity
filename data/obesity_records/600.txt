Discharge Date: 1/3/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Sepsis related to Streptococcal laryngitis
( culture positive ).
OTHER SIGNIFICANT DIAGNOSES: Status post heart transplant in 1989
for viral myocarditis and hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a charming 28-year-old
woman who was diagnosed with viral
myocardial myopathy in 8/2 and received a heart transplant at
Bussadd Southrys Community Hospital at that time. She did very well with only one
episode of rejection in 1995 , which was treated with OKT-3. She
also successfully carried out a pregnancy. The patient's husband
reports that she began complaining of sore throat approximately two
days prior to admission and then one day prior to admission
developed fever in early morning of 102.2 with myalgias. She had
poor p.o. intake throughout the weekend and had no nausea and
vomiting at home but developed some in the emergency room. She had
however , had some diarrhea with loose stools , no blood. She felt
dizzy and weak today while getting into the car. She took
over-the-counter medications at home. Her daughter was ill
approximately two months ago and the patient works at a child day
care center where many of the children are ill. She had some lower
abdominal pain but no dysuria or hematuria , no cough , no recent
travel , mild diffuse headache without nystagmus or photophobia. In
the emergency room the patient was afebrile , temperature 99.1 , but
was noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of 71/33 ,
tachycardic to 136 , respirations of 16 and 96% O2 saturated on room
air. She received two grams of ceftriaxone , 500 mg of levofloxacin
and 1 gram of vancomycin as well as three liters of normal saline ,
intravenous fluid rapid infusion. Her blood pressure was still
marginal from the 80s to 90s systolic. Neo was started at 40 mcg
through peripheral intravenous line and she was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: In addition to the previously mentioned
viral myocarditis and heart transplant in
1989 , with rejection in 1995 treated with OKT-3. She also had
chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine from 1.3 to
2.1 , usually in the 1.5 area. She has hypertension. She is
gravida 1 , para 1 , complicated by toxemia requiring Cesarean
section. She also had hyperlipidemia and obesity.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT: Included cyclophosphamide 100 mg b.i.d. ,
Cardura 10 mg q.d. , Imuran 75 mg q.d. ,
prednisone 10 mg q.d. , Vasotec 5 mg q.d. , Pravachol 40 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES: To penicillin and Sulfa which resulted in rashes.
Allergy to intravenous contrast dye which resulted in
pruritic hives. Morphine causing nausea and vomiting and
succinylcholine which the patient reports resulted in respiratory
arrest.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission to the Coronary Care Unit , the
patient's temperature was noted to be 102.6.
She was in sinus tachycardia to the 130s , slightly tachypneic up
to 24 , blood pressure of 98/40 , already on 40 mcg of Neo
intravenously. General: Drowsy , ill-appearing , flush young woman.
Pupils equal , round and reactive to light bilaterally. Extraocular
movements intact. Oropharynx was erythematous with some slight
white exudate on the tonsils and pharynx bilaterally. Mucous
membranes were dry with some white , red exudate on the tongue. She
had some tender cervical chains but not discrete palpable
lymphadenopathy with no neck stiffness , no sinus tenderness.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. There was no dullness
to percussion. Cardiovascular: Revealed rapid but regular rhythm ,
normal S1 and S2 , with positive S3 at the apex. Abdomen: Soft ,
nondistended , normal bowel sounds , diffuse , mild tenderness
throughout. Extremities: Warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally. Hands pale with cold fingers. Neurologic: Alert but
drowsy and oriented times four. She was grossly nonfocal.
Examination was limited secondary to the patient's discomfort.
LABORATORY/X-RAY STUDIES: Sodium 137 , potassium 5.0 , chloride 103 ,
bicarbonate 23 , BUN 46 , creatinine 2.8
which was increased from her previous baseline of 1.7 , glucose 92 ,
CK 22 , with troponin 0.07. Last cyclosporine level was 140s to
260s. White blood cells 7.6 with 68 polys and 25 bands.
Hemoglobin 11.3 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 157 , 000. PT 12.9 , INR
1.2 , PTT 33. EKG on admission was sinus tachycardia at 130 with a
normal axis incomplete right bundle branch block with Qs in III and
AVF , no ST-T wave changes and low volts across. Portable chest
x-ray on admission was clear. Blood cultures , throat cultures and
fungal isolators were sent off as well as EBV , CMV-IgM. Throat
culture grew out group A Strep. The patient had some improvement
with levofloxacin and briefly received vancomycin and gentamicin as
well prior to her culture growing out. The patient had worsening
renal function , likely due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to
prerenal azotemia from her initial hypotensive episodes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated briefly with vancomycin
and gentamicin. Throat culture grew out group A
Streptococcus. She improved on levofloxacin. Renal function
worsened likely due to acute tubular necrosis of prerenal azotemia
secondary to her initial hypotensive episodes on admission. She
gradually improved to a creatinine of 1.7 on the day of discharge.
During her hospitalization , she had some mild to moderate pulmonary
edema secondary to vigorous intravenous fluid resuscitation and
support of her blood pressure. She was diuresed with Lasix 20 to
40 mg intravenously q.d. for two days with excellent response and
was discharged below her dry weight. Her diarrhea with nausea and
vomiting was presumptively treated with Flagyl. However ,
Clostridium difficile was negative times two. Ova and parasites ,
fecaliths and stool cultures were all negative. She received
symptomatic relief with Compazine and Imodium. The patient's
baseline hypertension reappeared after her blood pressures had
stabilized and she was restarted on her outpatient regimen of
Vasotec and Cardura. Her baseline tachycardia was found to have
been evidently longstanding and well tolerated with heart rate of
100 to 120s.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in good condition
on day #5 of a ten-day course of levofloxacin at
renal dose , 250 mg p.o. q.d. and she also continued her usual
immunosuppressive regimen with a cyclosporine level of 454. She
had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Duenwald in one week after
discharge. Discharge medications included Imuran 75 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Sandimmune 100 mg b.i.d. , Vasotec 5 mg b.i.d. , Miracle Cream
topically q.d. , prednisone 10 mg q.a.m. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. ,
Cardura 10 mg q.d. , Compazine 5 to 10 mg q.4-6h. prn nausea and
vomiting , Pepto-Bismol 30 ml q.1h. prn diarrhea up to a total of
eight doses in 24 hours , levofloxacin 250 mg q.d. times a total of
ten-day course , Imodium 2 mg q.6h prn diarrhea , Lasix 20 mg q.d.
prn increased weight by two pounds above her baseline weight of
99 kg.
