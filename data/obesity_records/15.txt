PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: FEVER , STATUS POST CARDIAC
TRANSPLANT
OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA; 2 ) THROMBO-
CYTOPENIA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Breckenridge is a 50 year old
male who is ten years status post
cardiac transplant for an ischemic cardiomyopathy , who presents
with a five week history of a flu like illness and fevers. Cardiac
transplant was in 1985 without complications and in 1989 he had one
episode of herpes zoster , and was treated for cataract. He
remained stable without cardiac symptoms or exertional limitation.
Last had a cardiac catheterization in April of 1994 , showed no
evidence of coronary artery disease , normal LV size and function ,
normal RV and trace MR. Right heart catheterization on 7/10 showed
normal hemodynamics. There was no evidence of rejection on biopsy.
There was no history of signs or symptoms localizing infectious
process until about five weeks prior to this admission when he
developed a flu like symptom , including a dry cough , occasionally
productive of whitish sputum , general malaise , nasal congestion
with occasional blood streaked secretions , arthralgias and fatigue.
He also reports dyspnea on exertion after one flight at moderate
pace with occasional night sweats and loose stools. Multiple family
members were ill with similar symptom complexes. The patient took
one week off from work and felt that he was getting better until
approximately 24 hours prior to admission when he again had
increased weakness , muscle and joint aches , fevers to 101.2 P O ,
shaking chills , continued dry cough and headache. Diarrhea
spontaneously resolved but has had persistent dyspnea on exertion.
The patient denies any PND , orthopnea , chest pain , nausea and
vomiting. Has had anorexia with a 15 pound weight loss in the past
month. He is currently being admitted for evaluation and management
of his flu like illness following his cardiac transplant. He is
immunosuppresed with Cyclosporin , Prednisone and Imuran.

tension; 3 ) status post bilateral
cataract surgeries; 4 ) herpes
zoster flare.

FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He smoked one pack per day. Denies
alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a middle aged male in
no apparent distress. Temperature is
99.3 degrees P O. Pulse is 102 and regular. Breaths are 16 , even
and unlabored , 97% oxygen saturation at room air and blood pressure
is 120/76. His skin was within normal limits , mild scleral icterus.
Jugular venous pressure was 6 cm. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally
without bruits. There is no thyromegaly or adenopathy. His lungs
were clear bilaterally. Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2.
There are no murmurs , gallops or rubs. There is a regular rate and
rhythm. His PMI was non displaced. Abdomen was soft and non tender ,
non distended , normoactive bowel sounds with no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities without cyanosis , clubbing or edema or rashes. Distal
pulses were 2+ bilaterally and neurological exam was completely non
focal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Of significance , BUN was 27 ,
creatinine 1.8 , white blood cells
were 5.3 , with 71% PMNs and 10% bands , 4% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes
and 4% eosinophils. Platelet count was depressed at 90 , 000 ,
hematocrit was low at 30%; LDH was 302 and elevated; bilirubin was
elevated at 2.2 , total over 1.1 direct and Cyclosporin level on
admission was 276. Admission chest x-ray showed enlarged
mediastinal silhouette. There was no infiltrates or effusion. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia , rate of 106; axis was +6 degrees ,
intervals were .14/.08/.30 and RSR prime in V1 anterior T wave
inversion. There were no acute changes. His blood smear showed no
evidence of hemolysis. There are no schistocytes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50 year old gentleman who
is ten years status post cardiac
transplant , who presents with waxing and waning flu like illness
with fevers and left shift. Of note is hyperbilirubinemia with an
elevated LDH , in conjunction with anemia , suggestive of hemolysis
and also thrombocytopenia. It was felt that patient most likely
had an infectious process. Infectious Disease was contacted. The
patient had multiple blood cultures , sputum cultures , sputum
analyses and titers drawn with a completely negative workup , except
for E. coli noted on several sputum stains but there is no other
evidence for pneumonia. The patient was empirically treated for
several days on intravenous Cefuroxime with no change in his fever
curve , which had ranged from 100 to 102 degrees for all the days of
admission except the last 24 days of admission when patient was
afebrile. Most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms and
signs is a viral illness of unclear etiology. The fevers , joint
aches , upper respiratory symptoms all resolved by the time of
discharge. With regards to the patient's anemia , there was no
specific diagnosis made , despite extensive workup. The hematology
oncology service was consulted , and stated that the patient's
peripheral smear was normal , as it had been by our reading. They
still wanted to check a PNH screen and G6PD level in three to four
weeks following discharge for possible explanations of his
hemolytic anemia , although may be possibly related to a viral
illness as well. By the time of discharge , the patient's
hematocrit was stable at 30% and there was no further increase in
the patient's LDH or bilirubin; in fact those levels were resolving
by the time of discharge. The thrombocytopenia again may be
related to the viral illness and there is no evidence for hemolytic
uremic syndrome or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Also during
this visit , a PPD was checked and it was found that the patient was
anergic , as might be expected with all of his immunosuppressive
drug regimen. At the time of discharge , the patient was feeling
well and no longer complaining of his flu like syndrome.

sporin , 100 mg P O b.i.d.; 3 )

Imuran , 150 mg P O q d
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home ,
