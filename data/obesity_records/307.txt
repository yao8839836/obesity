Impression: 55F with CRI p/w progression of CKD to ESRD. UTI may be

Hospital course:
CARDIAC: Mildly tachycardic in-house , going in and out of Atrial Flutter
and Atrial Fibrillation. Beta Blocker titrated to Toprol XL 200 mg BID
with satisfactory rate control. Nifedipine and Metolazone were
held in-house , given need for BP room for rate control. Her BP
remained well-controlled despite her being off of these meds. She was
otherwise asymptomatic. Patient was begun on Coumadin on discharge , with
INR to be followed by PCP and PUO Coumadin clinic. TSH WNL. Echo also
unremarkable with EF 55-60%.
RENAL: ARF , likely progression of CKD with UTI contributory cause.
Initiated dialysis on 10/13 .  Repeat dialysis on 5/24 noted poor flow , was
referred to IR for fistulogram. Fistulogram revealed stenosis of graft ,
which was angioplastied with good flow. Nevertheless , pt had placement
of HD catheter on 11/3 as access to the graft was still difficult. She
has f/u with vascular surgery ( Loerwald ) for possible graft correction
in near future. Pt continued on Lasix 200 mg BID , Cozaar and Vasotec ,
per renal. Sevelamer was increased to 1200 TID due to slight
hyperphosphatemia.
ALLERGY: Pt notes potential allergy to IV dye. She received prednisone
60 mg 12 hours and 2 hours prior to her fistulogram. She tolerated the
fistulogram well.
ID: E Coli UTI. Treating with Ciprofloxacin for 7 days.
ENDOCRINE: Continued insulin while in-house. Three episodes of early
morning hypoglycemia ( FS 30-50s ) were noted. Her evening NPH were
decreased while she was in-house. These episodes were asymptomatic ,
likely due to poor POs and repeated runs of NPO while she was in-house.
She is to resume her regular insulin regimen on discharge.
HEME: Begun on coumadin at discharge for new AFib. She will have her
labs drawn at her PCP's office. The PUO coumadin clinic ( 405 ) 082-3371
will follow her INRs , with target 2-3.
FEN: Renal diet+diabetic+low fat diet.
PPX: PPI , heparin 5000U BID , colace

mg three times a day with meals , Ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice a day for 5
days. STOP Nifedipine and Metolazone until you see Dr. Bockemehl .

2. Coumadin: INR eventually to be drawn regularly at PCP's office. Please
call in the results to PUO Coumadin Clinic at 988-605-5355 - they will
instruct the patient to vary her dose if needed to target INR 2-3.
3. GRAFT: Please see Dr. Loerwald ( vascular surgery ) at PUO on 2/28 at
