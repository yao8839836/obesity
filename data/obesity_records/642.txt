Discharge Date: 4/5/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2.
Hyperlipidemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 50 year old gentleman
with a history of CAD dating back to
1991 when the cath showed one vessel disease. He was not
angioplastied. The patient had an MI at that time which was
medically managed. The patient did well until July of 1995 when
the patient had another anterior MI , massive , treated with
thrombolytics. Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a 99%
proximal RCA and serial 70% LAD lesions. The patient also was
noted to have a severe LV dysfunction with an ejection fraction of
28% and his MI was complicated by a complete heart block and a dual
chamber pacemaker was placed. At that time the patient was
considered to be a surgical candidate secondary to high risk. In
August of 1995 the patient was admitted for non Q wave MI with a
peak CK of 798 , positive MB fraction , and was again treated with
thrombolysis with TPA. The patient did well with no anginal
symptoms but has had primarily symptoms of CHF with dyspnea upon
exertion , progressive shortness of breath , and limited exercise
tolerance since that time. In July of 1996 the patient had an
exercise tolerance test with oxygen consumption measured at 11.8
ml/kg. The patient exercised for 6 minutes and reached a maximal
heart rate of 114 and stopped secondary to dyspnea. Given the
patient's poor functional status he presented for cardiac
catheterization and complete workup for cardiac transplant. The
patient admits no shortness of breath at rest but with 1-2 flights
of steps. He also becomes short of breath with ten minutes of
light labor. The patient also has daily angina with neck pain
radiating to his head which is relieved with rest.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CAD , as above status post MI times three
in 1991 and 1995 twice. 2. CHF , ischemic
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 28% since July of 1995.
3. Hyperlipidemia with a cholesterol in the 300s.

55. Positive for diabetes mellitus in a paternal uncle. Positive

respirations rate of 18 , T max was 97.6. In
general a middle aged male in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils
equal , round , and reactive to light , extraocular movements intact ,
poor dentition. Neck was supple with a JVD of 9 cm. Positive
jugular reflux , no bruits. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm , S1
and S2 , positive S3 , no murmurs. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN: Positive bowel sounds , no masses , non-tender.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pulses , no edema. NEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented

Guaiac negative. Prostate no nodules.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 145 , potassium 4.9 , chloride
102 , bicarb 28 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.5 ,
glucose of 90. Calcium of 9.9 , phosphorus 3.4 , cholesterol 178 ,
triglycerides 129. Hematocrit 54 , white count of 5.5 , platelet
count of 188 , 000. PT 1.3 , PTT of 30.5. LFTs: AST 54 , ALT 39.
EKG showed a left bundle branch block with Q waves in V1 and V3 ,
biatrial enlargement , inverted T waves in II , III , and AVF. Chest
x-ray revealed cardiomegaly , DDD pacer wires in position , lungs
clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted originally for a workup
for cardiac transplant. The patient had a
cardiac transplant labs drawn , had a PPD placed , which was negative
with positive controls. The patient had a psychiatry consult.
Hepatitis serology for hepatitis B and C were negative. The
patient was kept on heparin at therapeutic levels and was diuresed
with Lasix. His Captopril was also increased. The patient was
also treated with Isordil. At this point the patient was
reassessed and it was thought that he might be a candidate for a
revascularization. With this in mind , the patient was scheduled
for a ETT Thallium which if positive for ischemia he would go for a
cardiac catheterization. In the meantime the patient was medically
managed , diuresed of three to four liters over the several days of
admission. His Isordil was increased and he was continued on aspirin and
digoxin , on Mevacor. Further transplant labs revealed a TSH of
2.8 , T3 of 159 , T4 of 7.8. Urine 24 hour collection total volume
was 4200 cc , creatinine of 29 , urine protein less than assay. The
patient had his ETT Thallium which showed a question of septal
ischemia with a fixed apical defect. The patient went 6 minutes on
a standard Bruce protocol with a maximum heart rate of 156 , stopped
secondary to chest pain and 1 mm ST segment depressions. The
patient went to cardiac catheterization the following day. The
patient's cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel disease
with a 100% LAD. His catheterization film was evaluated by cardiac
surgery , Dr. Colasamte who believed that the patient would not benefit
from a CABG. Given this , the patient received a continued
transplant workup of a CT of the abdomen , as well as a dental
consult , with a planned tooth extraction , with appropriate
premedication with amoxicillin , and holding of his heparin. The
patient tolerated this well. Preliminary report on the CT of the
abdomen showed a small single less than 1 cm hepatic lesion. The
patient was medically stable on discharge.
The patient was found to have increasing LFT's upon discharge. Subsequently ,
his mevacor was dicontinued and LFT's returned to norma. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix
80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q.day
( Discontinued immediately after discharge ) , Coumadin to be taken for 5 mg
q.h.s. for four days and then to resume the 2.5 mg
with 5 mg q.o.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with the Cardiomyopathy
Service. The patient will be followed up to see how he
is tolerating his new medical regimen and be further evaluated for
cardiac transplant.
