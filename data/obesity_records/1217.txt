ATTENDING: KERTESZ , ALETA M.D.
This is a discharge summary dictation addendum to the previously
dictated note dictated by Coletta Verry , PA-C , describing
Mr. Krizan ' preoperative history , physical , operative procedure
( CABG x3 ) on 8/9/06 and postoperative course from 8/9/06
through 1/13/06.
While on the cardiac surgery step-down unit , Mr. Krizan continued
to demonstrate swollen ecchymotic area at the left lower extremity
along the SVG harvest site incision with white blood cell count
rising to 15.6 on 10/25/06 , although remaining afebrile. A left
lower extremity ultrasound obtained at that time revealed a fluid
collection along the prior SVG tract , corresponding to the area with
the most significant erythema. Mr. Krizan was continued on
vancomycin and levofloxacin and was taken back to the operating
room on 9/6/06 for drainage and irrigation of left lower extremity
endoscopic saphenous vein harvest site. No obvious purulence was noted
in the operating room. Cultures were sent from the OR which
subsequently revealed no growth. Postoperatively , the wound was
packed with wet-to-dry dressing , changed daily , and the patient
was continued on vancomycin IV antibiotics with white blood cell
count improving. Following operative reintervention , SVG harvest
site incision appeared less inflamed , less tender and less erythematous ,
with corresponding improvement in cellulitis. A plan had been made to
subsequently discharge the patient on postoperative day #13 , 5/2/06.
A long line was placed at this time in anticipation of discharge for
continuation of seven days of IV vancomycin. However , white blood
count rose to 19.4 on planned day of discharge , 3/28/06 , and ,
althought the patient remained afebrile and the wound continued to
remain clean with minimal cellulitis , Mr. Krizan was kept inpatient
overnight for continued observation and re-assessment of WBC. On
3/25/06 , white blood cell count improved to 14.3 , the patient
remained afebrile , and the wound continued to remain clean with
packing changed wet-to-dry daily. Additional sources of leukocytosis
were sought including sputum culture , which subsequently demonstrated
no significant growth. Urinalysis was noted to be mildly dirty , for
which the patient began a short course of p.o. levofloxacin.
Sternal wound continued to remain intact with no sternal click ,
erythema , or drainage noted. Mr. Krizan is discharged to
rehabilitation today , postoperative day #14 , for continued
cardiopulmonary rehabilitation following coronary artery bypass
graft x3 and drainage and irrigation of left extremity saphenous vein
harvest site.
