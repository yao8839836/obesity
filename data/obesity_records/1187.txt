HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old female with a history of
diverticulitis who presented with crampy
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting times several days. CT on
admission noted a diverticular abscess. CT was unable to drain it
due to its limited size. However , the patient continued to have
crampy abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting. The patient was taken
to the OR on 10/19/01 for an exploratory laparotomy , sigmoid
colectomy and colostomy. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was maintained NPO , with an epidural for pain control , until
return of bowel function as witnessed by the gas and feces in the
colostomy bag.
By the time of discharge , the patient was ambulating with a wheeled
walker. She was tolerating a regular diet , had good pain control
on 2-4 mg q.4h. of Dilaudid. Of note , the patient has a
significant history of coronary artery disease , had a rule out MI
postoperatively with initial evidence of cardiac injury. However ,
the patient did complain of some atypical chest pain on
postoperative day #3. A repeat rule out MI illustrated a troponin
leak likely secondary to increased cardiac demands postoperatively.
The patient was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. in order to
control rates with a good effect. The patient was also continued
on a course of IV antibiotics , ampicillin , ceftazidime , Flagyl and
Diflucan. Drainage from that particular abscess eventually
revealed enterococci , yeast and Pseudomonas responsive to these
antibiotics.
