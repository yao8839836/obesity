Discharge Date: 1/19/2001
DIAGNOSIS: Gangrenous left great toe
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Merles is a 48 year old male with a
history of brittle diabetes and known history of peripheral
vascular disease , end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and a
long history of smoking , who initially presented with dry gangrene
of the distal aspect of his left great toe.
He underwent a first toe amputation on April , 2001 , and this was
complicated by poor healing requiring debridement twice during this
hospital stay. The wound was then irrigated and closed in the
Operating Room on March , 2001. However at his follow up visit
to the clinic , his wound was erythematous and appeared to be
questionably infected. Thus , the wound was opened and debrided on
the day prior to the current admission. The patient reported a
history of chills but no fever.
Mr. Merles now presents preoperatively for an operative debridement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Insulin-dependent diabetes.
2. End stage renal disease on hemodialysis on Tuesday , Thursday
and Saturday.
3. Hypertension.
4. Peripheral vascular disease.
5. ETOH abuse.
6. Tobacco abuse.
7. Hepatitis C virus positive.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Enteric coated aspirin , 325 mg p.o.
q.d.; Atenolol , 50 mg p.o. q.d.; calcium acetate , 1334 mg p.o.
q.d.; Zestril , 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Prilosec , 20 mg p.o. q.d.;
insulin , 70-30 , 20 units subcutaneously q a.m. , 8 units
subcutaneously q p.m.; Norvasc , 10 mg p.o. q.d. and Percocet prn
pain.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile with
stable vital signs. In general , he was a thin appearing , middle
aged Hispanic gentleman in no acute distress. His lungs were
clear. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI
systolic ejection murmur radiating to his neck. His abdomen was
soft , non-tender , non-distended. His extremities had no edema.
His pulse examination showed palpable bilateral femoral pulses and
dopplerable DP , PT and peroneal pulses bilaterally. On his left
great toe , there was an open wound with no purulent discharge and
minimal erythema in the surrounding skin.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 136 , potassium 4.9 , chloride 96 ,
bicarbonate 36 , BUN 17 , creatinine 3.8 and a glucose of 469. CBC -
9.4 , hematocrit 30.3 and platelet count of 460. INR of 1.2.
Of note , his angiogram showed that his left common iliac artery had
diffuse disease. His external iliac artery on the left had a 40%
proximal stenosis. His left SFA had proximal 50 to 60% stenosis
and mid-50% stenosis. His popliteal had 50% disease and his tibial
peroneal trunk on the left had moderate disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Vascular Service
and started on Vancomycin , Levofloxacin and Flagyl. His wound was
changed b.i.d. and he was prepared for an operative debridement of
his left great toe. His pulses continued to be dopplerable. Of
note , the patient had very difficult to control diabetes , being
admitted with sugars in the 400 to 500 range , requiring IV insulin
boluses.
On hospital day #3 , he was taken to the Operating Room for a
debridement of his left great toe amputation and an amputation of
his second toe with primary closure. This was done under ankle
block and was uncomplicated.
The patient had a postoperative course significant for his very
difficult to control diabetes with intermittent hypoglycemia to the
40s and hyperglycemia up to the 600s range. He did receive a
consult by the diabetes team who changed his regimen to 70-30
insulin , 22 units q a.m. , 8 units of NPH insulin at 10:00 p.m. and
four units of regular insulin q p.m. , one-half hour before his
supper. He was to be covered with a sliding scale four times a
day.
The patient did receive Vancomycin , Levofloxacin and Flagyl for the
majority of his hospital stay for a total of ten days. He was
afebrile and his white blood count remained in the 8.0 to 9.0
range.
Mr. Merles received his dialysis as per his usual schedule of
Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday.
The patient did have some intermittent diarrhea , for which C. diff
was sent and his cultures at this time are still pending with no
fecal leukocytes seen on his stool sample.
On postoperative day #5 , the patient did have a white blood count
up to the 10 , 000 to 11 , 000 range and on postoperative day 7 , there
was some slight , questionably purulent drainage from his incision
line , thus a couple of sutures were removed and his wound was
opened. There was no fluid collection or pus found in the deep
wound. The wound was dressed with wet to dry dressing changes
b.i.d. using normal saline and was directed specifically to not be
packed tightly but just to be wicked open.
His antibiotics were changed to Augmentin and Levofloxacin
impirically , as the patient's cultures from the wound drainage from
negative as of the time of discharge. He will also be continued on
Flagyl for impiric coverage of C. diff , in case his C. diff toxin
turns out positive. His antibiotics should continue for another
six days post-discharge and this will complete a 2.5 week course of
antibiotics for him.
The patient had no cardiac issues while in house. He was
hemodynamically stable.
Of note , his sugars did trough on postoperative day #9 to a low of
46 and he was reconsulted by the diabetes team with recommendations
to decrease his insulin; 70-30 in the morning to 18 units , instead
of 22 units. He will continue his NPH and regular insulin coverage
as previously recommended.
On discharge , the patient is afebrile with stable vital signs. His
lungs are clear. Heart is regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen is
soft , non-tender , non-distended. His pulses are still dopplerable
bilaterally. His wound has no erythema and is packed open with
clean granulation tissue and some slight fibrinous exudate in the
wound. He has no distal edema.
