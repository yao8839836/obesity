Discharge Date: 9/23/2007
ATTENDING: YEAGLEY , MA GLADIS MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Bacteremia , hypotension , coronary artery
disease , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chills/hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Broitzman is a pleasant
69-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD , PVD , diabetes who
presents with 3 days of feeling poorly. He initially had lower
abdominal pain 4/10/2007. He went to see his primary care
doctor on 7/26/2007 where labs were drawn. He had one episode
of emesis ( watery and nonbilious ). On the day of admission , he
woke up with chills and called his PCP who recommended he go to
the ED for further evaluations.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Remarkable for a poor appetite. He denied
any shortness of breath , cough , current abdominal pain , diarrhea ,
or dysuria. In the ED his temperature was 104.8 , his blood
pressure was 70/45 , with heart rate in the 120s. His exam was
also remarkable for altered mental status with confusion
regarding dates and requiring frequent reorientation. A central
line was placed and he was given vancomycin , levofloxacin , and
Flagyl prior to transfer to the MICU for further care.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes type 2 which has
been diet controlled , hypercholesterolemia , coronary artery
disease status post 4 vessel CABG in 2004 , EF of 35% ( per echo in
2004 ) , history of A-Fib on chronic Coumadin , a history of
peripheral vascular disease status post left popliteal bypass ,
bilateral ankle grafts , gallstones on right upper quadrant
ultrasound in 2/27
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin , atenolol , lisinopril , Lasix ,
Zocor , digoxin , Cilostazol , multivitamins , Protonix , K-Dur ,
Ambien , lorazepam , and Coumadin.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes hives , Norvasc , Plavix ( GI upset ).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission on transfer to floor after
MICU stabilization , temperature 97.9 , heart rate 99 , blood
pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 20 , sating 100% on 2 liters. In
general , he was awake and alert , and appropriately answering
questions. His HEENT exam was notable for upper dentures.
Otherwise , his oropharynx was clear. His neck was supple , a
right IJ was in place. He had no bruits. His lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally. His heart rate was tachycardic ,
irregularly irregular , without any murmurs. His abdomen was
soft , nontender , nondistended , with good bowel sounds with no
hepatosplenomegaly and a negative Murphy's sign. His extremities
had no edema. There were trace DP pulses. His bilateral
extremities were cool. His neuro exam , he was alert and oriented
x3. He was moving all extremities and his cranial nerves were
intact.
STUDIES/PROCEDURES:
Surgery: A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted and
failed. "White bile" drained from his gallbladder , his liver was
very friable. The surgeons aborted the procedure and recommended
medical therapy.
CT of Abdomen/Pelvis: Demonstrated ascending/transverse colitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cholecystitis/Bacteremia: The patient presented with septic
physiology with the source thought to be acute cholecystitis. He
was brought to the OR for laparoscopic cholecystectomy which was
aborted due to his liver disease causing his friable liver and
his high operative risk. The surgical team recommended medical
therapy. He improved markedly on Cipro/Flagyl and is planned for
a 2-week course at discharge. Due to his liver disease ,
hepatitis serologies were checked which did not reveal ongoing
infection. It is recommended that he follow up with a
gastroenterologist for further workup.
2. Cardiovascular ( Ischemia ): Mr. Broitzman has a history of
CAD status post CABG with an episode of hypotension/sepsis. In
this setting , he had an NSTEMI with troponin peaking at 0.95. He
is continued on his aspirin and his statin.
3. Cardiovascular ( Pump ): Given his septic presentation , his
antihypertensives were initially held. They were restarted 3
days prior to discharge , and Mr. Broitzman had pressures in the
90s but was asymptomatic with these pressures. It was thought
that he was clinically dry. So , Lasix was held at discharge with
the plan to restart them with any weight gain ( the patient weighs
himself daily ) , shortness of breath as advised by his cardiac
nurse ( who will see early on the week of discharge ).
4. Cardiovascular ( Rhythm ): Mr. Broitzman has a history of
A-Fib on Coumadin , digoxin , and atenolol at home. He will be
discharged on Coumadin/digoxin/Lopressor given his marginal blood
pressures with low-dose beta blockade.
5. Heme: The patient's INR increased to 3.9 at the time of
discharge ( likely secondary to Cipro and Coumadin interaction ).
This was discussed with the patient's Megoo Sweven Hospital anticoagulation
nurse and plans were made to hold Coumadin for 3 days' time and
recheck it on 11/23/2007.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , ciprofloxacin 250 mg
every 12 hours , digoxin 0.25 mg daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. twice
daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg at bedtime , Maalox p.r.n. upset stomach ,
Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. , omeprazole 40 mg
b.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , Zocor 40 mg nightly ,
multivitamin one tablet daily.
