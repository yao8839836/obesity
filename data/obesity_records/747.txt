Labs: Hct 33.9 , cardiac enz neg x3
RUQ u/s large complex liver cyst
MRI: 8 cm complex cystic hepatic lesion with mild enhancement. Despite
the peripheral location , the most likely diagnosis would be a biliary
cystadenoma. Other entities remained in the differential , however ,
including biliary cystadenocarcinoma , a thrombosed hemangioma , cystic
metastases , and infection ( hydatid or abscess ). If available , access to
any prior outside imaging would be helpful to distinguish these.
Otherwise , follow-up or biopsy could be considered. Nonenhancing cystic
lesion in the spleen , likely a splenic cyst or hemangioma.
*****************
Hospital Course:
73 yo with probable CAD , presents with abd/chest pressure. Was ruled out
for MI , and f/u MIBI actually demonstrated interval improvement in cardiac
disease. As the pain was epigastric in location , pursued further imaging
of liver cyst.
1. CV: R/o by negative enzymes x 3 , ASA , statin , BB. No recurrence of the
pain following admission. Stress PET on 6/26 did not demonstrate any
reversible perfusion defect ( unlike prior study 6/8 ). Will continue
current medications. Given elevated BP on admission ( and control on 25
lopressor TID ) , will increase toprol from 25 to 50mg PO daily. Pt should
followup with PCP and cardiologist for further adjustments as needed. Dr.
Barnaba was notified of the patient's admission.
2. Abd pain. Pain appeared to have abdominal component , and given absence
of cardiac disease , pain may have more likely originated may be biliary or
hepatic area. Patient was continued on PPI. A RUQ u/s demonstrated small
gallstones and a sizable hepatic cyst ( previously known ). The cyst was
then characterized by MRI , which revealed likely
cystadenoma per preliminary report. This lesion should be closely
followed , and surgical options should be evaluated. Furthermore , the
possibility of biliary pain should be considered given presence of small
gallstones and timing of pain. Referral for elective laproscopic
cholecystectomy should be considered.
3. Psych. depression/anxiety/bipolar. Continued home medications with no
changes during the hospital stay.
4. Heme. Anemia , chronic at baseline. Should be followed as outpatient.
5. Reported h/o diabetes. A1C was 4.5. No treatment was given.
6. Hyperthyroidism. Continued levoxyl. TSH 2.808.
7. Periodontal pain. Patient reported pain in gums , ? infection. The
patient was offered chlorhexidine mouthwash and encouraged to followup
with her dentist as soon as possible for evaluation.
