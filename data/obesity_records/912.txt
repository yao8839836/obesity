R Foot plain films -- possible osteo of 1st , 4th and 5th metatarsal
( prelim read by ED Rads )
Pt was admitted to Vascular with diagnosis of non-healing TMA site &amp;
osteo despite apparent adequate revascularization. His foot was elevated
R foot , Triple Abx ( Vanc/Levo/Flagyl ) , and he was made NPO/IVF for
possible BKA. His hospital course was unremarkable. He did not go to the
OR. DM management was consulted and optimized his insulin regimen as well
as provided DM teaching. On PJ7 he underwent an MRI of the RLE revealing
extensive OM of the 3rd&gt;4th metatarsal heads , the cuboid , cunioform as
well as the calcaneuos. Blood cultures that were taken grew out MRSA from
6/7. His remaining blood cultures x 2 over 48 hours remained negetive.
The pt's WBC never rose above 7.8 with no left shift. His foot remained
stable with exam revealng chronic diabetic dermopathy and 3+ edema , no
open wound with minimal granulation tissue , no fluctuance , no cellulitis ,
no warmth or TTP. The patient will be dc'd and will return for elective
AKA 4/12 after his LE edema resolves. He will continue on linizolid as an
outpatient. On HD4 after an unremarkable hospital course the pt was seen
fit to be dc'd home with services for WTD dressing changes BID. He was
AFVSS , tolerating an ADA diet , and ambulating heel weight bearing only.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Pt will be sent home with WTD dressing changes BID. Keep leg elevated
while in bed. Will need to continue the linizolid x 10 days; will need
qweekly CBC check for thrombocytopenia. Pt. should
seek medical attention if there is increasing leg or arm pain , groin
swelling , T&gt;101.5 , redness/puss at the incision site , altered mental
status , symptoms of stroke ( eg HA , change in vision/speech , unilateral
loss of motor/sensation ).
