ATTENDING: STEFFANIE T. DOCIMO MD , PHD
ATTENDING: Rossie Mankoski , M.D.
ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: Non-ST elevation MI.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: Thromboembolic coronary artery occlusion ,
rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve replacement , aortic valve
replacement with St. Jude's valve , status post tricuspid repair ,
CHF , type II diabetes , atrial fibrillation , esophageal ulcer ,
osteoporosis.
In brief , Ms. Wolsey is a 63-year-old Hindi speaking woman with
CAD , rheumatic heart disease , status post mitral valve
replacement , aortic valve replacement , A. fib , diabetes type II ,
history of subacute bacterial endocarditis transferred from
Norap Valley Hospital with a troponin of 64. She had presented with
several days of neck and back pain and some vague mild left sided
chest pain. No shortness of breath and diaphoresis. No cough.
At Norap Valley Hospital , EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with
some 1-2 mm depressions in V2 through V5. There was a question
of dig effect. Her chest x-ray demonstrated a right lower lobe
infiltrate and patient was given aspirin , Lovenox and transferred
to PUO for catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD , rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve
replacement , aortic valve replacement , A. fib , SBE , diabetes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient presented again with a non-ST
elevation MI with elevated troponin. The patient had had a
negative catheterization just two years ago and it was unclear
whether or not her troponin leak was from epicardial coronary
artery disease or from another source such as pericarditis or
erosion from endocarditis into her myocardium. Also , given the
back pain , there was a concern for aortic dissection and a chest
CT was done on 8/4/04 which showed no aortic dissection. She
was continued on heparin , Plavix , aspirin , and beta-blocker and
will be restarted on her ACE inhibitor , was not restarted in
hospital , by her PCP. Given her continued neck pain with endemic
ST changes which included depressions in V2 through V5 , and her
substantial elevation in her troponin I to a peak of 64 , a
catheterization was done that demonstrated thrombosis on OM2 at
the ostia which was thought to be embolic. All her other
coronary arteries appeared normal , so this 100% lesion was
angioplastied to 50% residual. Post procedure course was
complicated by pulmonary edema with rising O2 requirement. She
diuresed well with improvement to room air , satting 100%. She
again had neck pain in V2 through V5 depressions on 6/17 , just
three days after the catheterization on 3/25 This was
medically managed because the dynamic changes did not return and
thought to be left over plaque from the last lesion. The patient
had been stable for about one week before discharge without any
complaints of neck pain whatsoever and her troponins had trended
down significantly during this event. The patient had not
complained of any symptoms while walking.
Pump-wise , her echo showed an EF of 60% with preserved LV and RV
function. Her old RVSP increased roughly to 65 , possible
increase in mitral gradient. The patient had had RVSP before and
it had been increased at roughly to 55 mmHg. Possible increase
in mitral gradient and no veg on her echo though it was tough to
evaluate given her artificial valve. The patient then had a TEE
which was negative for vegetation or thrombus. It was thought
that the thrombus she had already thrown to her OM2 would most
likely be the thrombus that she had had and there was none left
on the valves. For that reason , patient was volume overloaded
and was diuresed on torsemide 100 PO b.i.d. which seems to be a
good regimen for her as far as her dry weights seem to be around
50 kilos , maybe even 48 kilos , and she should have daily weights
checked.
Rhythm-wise , the patient had A. fib. She was on tele and no
events and she is being anticoagulated both for her valve and for
her A. fib.
ID-wise , she had increased white blood cell count and a left
shift with one band , the right lower lobe infiltrate and
completed a 7-day course of levo. Was afebrile throughout the
hospitalization and had negative blood cultures , and again the
negative TEE.
Heme-wise , her INR goal is now 3 to 4 , ideally 3 to 3.5 , and this
is essential. Patient will follow up with the Coumadin Clinic.
Her INR was 5.3 on 1/4/04. She was treated on 3/25/04. She
had an INR of ??__?? She is to be drawn by the VNA the next day ,
11/4/04 , and they should call Coumadin Clinic with the result.
Given high INR , we held the Coumadin on 10/20 and restarted dose
on 6/26 at a dose of 3 q.p.m.
Respiratory-wise , the patient finished levo for presumed
pneumonia and had no other respiratory problems. She did
complain sometimes of subjective shortness of breath , but her
oxygen saturation remained at 100% throughout the rest of the
hospitalization besides after the cath.
GI-wise , she is stable. She got some simethicone for gas and a
bowel regimen. She was doing well , but given her continued pain ,
GI and surgery consulted on her for a question of mesenteric
ischemia. A CT angiogram of the abdomen was performed with
negative workup for mesenteric ischemia. They thought that most
of her discomfort was due to constipation.
FEN-wise , we replaced her lytes. Also we put her on carnitine
for diet supplementation.
Renal-wise , the patient had increase in creatinine secondary to
the dye load from the cath and both her CT scans. The creatinine
was .9 on day of discharge. We held off on starting the ACE
because of this , but she should consider getting an ACE to add to
her regimen given her diabetes and recent MI. That should be
started as an outpatient.
Endocrine-wise , her diabetes is in really poor control. She had
sugars ranging from 40 to 400. We changed her regimen to Lantus
26 units q.p.m. along with novalog pre-meal with 16 before
breakfast and 8 of novalog before lunch and 8 of novalog before
dinner. Her sugars improved greatly , all in the 100s. She had
severe osteoporosis as well and vitamin C deficiency. Consider
starting Zometa as an outpatient per primary care doctor , Dr.
Bredeson Prophylaxis with heparin and Nexium.
DISPO: She refused rehab and wanted to go home with services and
she should get home PT and a home VNA. She is full code.
PLAN: Follow up with the Coumadin Clinic and get her blood drawn
every 2-3 days. The VNA should call 988-605-5355 with the
results of her INR. In addition , her goal again is to have an
INR of 3-4. She should follow up with Dr. Rochat , her
cardiologist , in 1-2 weeks and Dr. Dia Riemenschneid will come to
see her on 3/2 , 11:30 a.m. at her house. I also recommended
that patient not add salt to her diet and not drink fluids
greater than one liter per day and also check her daily weights.
