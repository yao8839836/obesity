Discharge Date: 2/16/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1 ) DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2 ) HYPOTENSION.
3 ) RENAL FAILURE.
4 ) PANCREATITIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Montecillo is a 45 year-old female with
dilated cardiomyopathy and a reported
history of myocarditis approximately fifteen years ago with a long
history of ethanol abuse. In October , 1995 , she was admitted to
Pagham University Of with upper respiratory symptoms and
progressive shortness of breath with cardiomegaly. An
echocardiogram at that time revealed an ejection fraction of 15%
with global hypokinesis , two to three plus mitral regurgitation and
a normal right ventricle. She underwent catheterization which
showed a right dominates and no coronary artery disease. An
exercise treadmill test scan show maximal VO2 of 12.6 milliliters
per kilogram per minute. More recently an echocardiogram in
October , 1997 , show an injections fraction of 20% with moderate
mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement. She has been
managed on Digoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. On this regimen
she continued to have orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
dyspnea on excretion. She was recently seen by Dr. Board in early
February , 1997 , and give a prescription for Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg. She
did not take this medication until two days before her admission
and subsequently had brisk diuresis. Over the last week prior to
her admission she experienced mild abdominal pain without
radiation. She had no change in her bowel movements. No bleeding
per rectum and no melena but had frequent vomiting. She presented
to the Car University Medical Center on July , 1997 , with the same
symptoms. Her creatinine was 1.3. Amylase was normal. An
abdominal CT was consistent with pancreatitis. Laboratory studies
were notable for an increased glucose , creatinine of 3.2 on
hospital day number two and then subsequently creatinine of 5.5.
She continued to have decrease in systolic blood pressure to the
70's and was urgently transferred to the Pagham University Of on a Dopamine and Insulin drip.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the following: 1 ) Dilated
cardiomyopathy , 2 ) Adult onset diabetes
mellitus , 3 ) History of appendectomy and 4 ) History of ovarian cyst
removal.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Penicillin.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Digoxin .375 q.d. , 2 ) Lasix 160
twice a day , 3 ) Captopril 2.5 twice a
day , 4 ) K-Dur 40 twice a day , 5 ) Magnesium oxide 1 gram three
times a day , 6 ) Aspirin once per day , 7 ) DiaBeta 10 twice a day
and 8 ) Zaroxolyn.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a 19 year-old son with
cardiomyopathy. The patient is a smoker and
drinks three glasses of Rum per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure was 40 on Doppler , heart rate
in the 150's , respiratory rate 16 , oxygen
saturation 96% , 100% with face mask. She was transferred on
Dopamine drip of 20 micrograms per kilograms per minute and Insulin
10 units per hour. Heent: Extraocular movements were intact.
Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light. Neck: Right
interna jugular triple-lumen catheter. Chest: Clear to
auscultation anteriorly and laterally. Cardiovascular: Regular
rhythm , tachycardic , no murmurs. Abdomen: Soft , diffusely tender.
Positive bowel sounds. No guarding or rebounds. Extremities: No
edema , cold , clammy and no distal pulses. Abdominal CT report from
the Car University Medical Center showed some degree of fatty
infiltration and diffused enlargement of pancreas with some
infiltration of the inferior peripancreatic border. No pseudocyst.
Chest x-ray: No congestive heart failure. PA catheter in good
condition. PA catheterization readings: Pulmonary artery
pressures 20 , Pulmonary capillary wedge 13 , central venous pressure
8. EKG sinus tachycardia at 162 beats per minutes. Axis 35
degrees , 1 millimeter ST depressions in V4 through V6 , and 1 ST
elevation in V1 through V3 with a left bundle branch block.

FENA of fractional secretion of sodium 2.15%. White blood cell
count 12.19 , hematocrit 41.4 , platelets 66. Differential 12
leukocytes , 11 monocytes , 76 neutrophils , no eosinophils , 0.3
basophils. PT 15.3 , PTT 34.4 , fibrin products less then 0.5 ,
fibrinogen 372 , INR 1.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated for a dilated
cardiomyopathy and severe pancreatitis. She
was vigorously hydrated for pancreatitis and had few complications.
In setting of her increased abdominal distension and development
of pleural effusion as well as sudation for ethanol withdrawal she
required intubation. Throughout her Intensive Care Unit admission
she had a high fever. An abdominal CT with IV contrast on August , 1997 , was negative for pancreatic necrosis and no tapable fluids
collection. She continued to be febrile as mentioned before
despite therapy with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Vancomycin and
Flagyl. She intermittently had coagulate negative staphylococcal
cultures from her lines which were changed as well as Xanthomonas
maltophilia for which she received Bactrim. At the time of her
transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Medical
Service she was usually linked with a baseline heart rate in the
120's and a systolic blood pressure in the 90's. The plan was to
restart her at low doses of a ACE inhibitor for after load
reduction , as tolerated. With careful surveillance of her fluid
status and maintenance of weight between 73 and 74 kilograms.
Pulmonary wise she was treated for seven days with Bactrim for the
Xanthomonas infection as well as chest PT daily. Her renal
function was at her baseline at the time of transfer. Infectious
Diseases as stated above she was treated with Bactrim for seven
days with a plan to reculture if her fever spikes. The patient was
transferred on total parenteral nutrition until she could tolerate
a p.o. diet.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient's congestive
heart failure improved and she was eubolemic
after extensive diuresis. She was started on high doses of Lasix
and then decreased to 80 mg p.o. q.d. with her weight being stable
in the 67 kilogram range. She remained tachycardic in the 110's to
120's with a systolic pressure in the 80's. She was able to
tolerate 6.25 mg of Captopril and thus was discharged on a dose of
2.5 mg of the Lisinopril daily.
2 ) Pulmonary: The patient's shortness of breath resolved as her
fluid status stabilized. At the time of discharge her lungs were
clear to auscultation and her oxygen saturation was in the high
90's on room air.
3 ) Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis resolved with lipase at the
time of discharge of 302. Amylase was normal. She had no further
abdominal pain. She declined a nasal gastric feeding tube but was
able to advance her diet. Nutrition was consulted and suggested
nutrition supplements which the patient was reluctant to take.
4 ) Infectious Diseases: The patient was not on any antibiotics at
the time of discharge and remained afebrile.
5 ) Physical Condition: The patient was able to walk and tolerate
light exercise. She had been orthostatic , dropping her blood
pressure to the 60's on standing up but was without symptoms. Her
orthostasis improved with decreasing the amount of diuresis. She
was scheduled to have Physical Therapy at home after discharge from
the hospital.
6 ) Mental Status: The patient's base lines at the beginning of
her admission was lethargic and confused. Her mental status
improved as her hemodynamic and cardiovascular status improved.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge the patient was
alert and oriented times three and in
good condition. The patient was very clear about her wishes not to
go to Rehabilitation Hospital and elected to go home with careful
VNA and Physical Therapy follow-up.
