HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old male with
morbid obesity and history of multiple DVTs and pulmonary emboli ,
status post IVC filter placement who presented to the emergency
room with hemoptysis episode x1. He reported two tablespoons of
bright red blood when coughed up , but he did not have a
persistent cough. No shortness of breath. No fevers , chills ,
night sweats or other symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Morbid obesity , DVTs , PEs , hypertension ,
total hip replacement and status post hernia repair.
ALLERGIES: Versed.
EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97 , respirations 22 , blood
pressure 114/78 , oxygen 97 on room air. General: He is obese ,
talkative , walking around. Had moist mucous membranes. Unable
to assess JVP due to size. Lungs: Clear. Heart: Regular
without murmurs. S1 and S2 were normal. Abdomen: Obese ,
nontender , and nondistended and soft. Extremities: Show chronic
venostasis changes without evidence of cyanosis , open wound and
some edema was present. EKG on admission showed normal sinus
rhythm at 74 beats per minute with no significant ST-T changes.
Chest x-ray that he brought from an outside hospital showed right
hilar prominence with question of a mass. Chest x-ray in the
emergency room at the Pagham University Of showed no
acute process and severe pulmonary congestion.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 144 , potassium 4.1 ,
chloride 102 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose
104 , white blood cell 3.7 , hematocrit 54 , platelets 188 , INR 2.1 ,
PTT 33. An echo in September 2005 showed mild LVH and ejection
fraction of 55%-60% , increased RV , right systolic function mildly
reduced and mild RAE and LAE.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In the emergency room , the patient received
vitamin K 6 mg x1 to reverse his Coumadin in the setting of
hemoptysis.
1. Pulmonary: The source of his hemoptysis was initially
unclear. His sputum looked only blood tinged on the admission
exam , but the patient reported bright red blood prior to
admission. His chest x-ray from the outside hospital looked like
a right hilar prominence , which was read as a possible mass , but
a repeat study done in the emergency room at the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of showed
only pulmonary congestion and no mass or acute process. He has
very minimal history of smoking cigarettes in the past. He was
too large to fit into a CAT scan machine , so he underwent a V/Q
scan , which demonstrated low probability for pulmonary embolus.
The pulmonary service was consulted and their impression was that
his hemoptysis was likely secondary to severe pulmonary
hypertension but not a mass or infection. They opted not to
perform a bronchoscopy and recommended starting sildenafil for
pulmonary hypertension. The Masan Oak Hospital , the Pulmonary
Hypertension Service was then consulted. They did not recommend
the sildenafil so that was actually not started. They did
recommend starting torsemide 80 b.i.d. for better diuresis and
this was initiated and resulted in good urine output. His home
dose of diuretic was 80 mg of Lasix daily. Upon discharge , he
was sent home on 80 mg of Lasix twice a day with recommendations
to have his blood drawn , to measure electrolytes within a week ,
and follow up with his PCP as soon as possible. The Lingwest Tal/ Hospital
recommended an outpatient cath and he was instructed to follow up
with them. He also reports a history of sleep apnea and BiPAP
use at home , although he admits that he does not use the BiPAP
machine. He was set up with BiPAP and nighttime oxygen inhouse
and he was continued on Coumadin for his history of pulmonary
emboli. His Coumadin was held initially on admission in the
setting of hemoptysis , but it was restarted after the V/Q scan
was low probability. He was also placed on a heparin drip while
the Coumadin was not therapeutic. He was discharged on 12 mg of
Coumadin daily.
2. Cardiovascular and hypertension: He was continued on his
home meds.
3. Infectious disease: He did develop bilateral lower extremity
erythema and tenderness on 1/14/05 and he was started on IV
Ancef 2 g q.8 h. for presumed cellulitis. This was changed to
Keflex upon discharge.
4. Gout: He continued on his home meds without incident.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to have his
lytes drawn within a week by the PCP , VNA , or lab center. He was
instructed to have his INR measured on Monday or Tuesday and for
the results to be sent to his PCP and/or the Coumadin Clinic. He
was instructed to use oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula for 15
hours overnight and to use the BiPAP machine and elevate his legs
while not walking or standing and to wear compression stockings.
ALLERGIES: Midazolam.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENT: He has an appointment with Dr. Lamia ,
