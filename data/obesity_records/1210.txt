STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN 1994 AND 1996.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old male
status post coronary artery bypass
grafting and sternal wound infection , admitted with 3 days of
increasing shortness of breath. The patient has had severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately
20% , and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. He underwent
a 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein
grafts to the LVB , D1 and first obtuse marginal on 19 of October His
postoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound infection ,
with debridement performed on 15 of May He was put on vancomycin
and sent home 3 days prior to admission on intravenous vancomycin.
He felt okay , until 1 or 2 days prior to admission when he had
increased dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath. He also
complained of increasing orthopnea and a mild cough accompanied by
shaking chills the night prior to admission. He also complained of
mild upper and lower back pain. The patient denied dysuria. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY is as noted above. The patient has no known drug
ALLERGIES. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were aspirin , 325 milligrams
each day , Captopril , 25 milligrams 3 times a day , digoxin , 0.125
milligrams each day , Lasix , 40 milligrams each day , Colace , 100
milligrams twice a day , NPH insulin , 35 units each morning , regular
insulin , 5 units each evening , metoprolol , 25 milligrams 3 times a
day , Niferex , 150 milligrams twice a day , Percocet as needed ,
vancomycin , 1.25 milligrams twice a day , Axid , 150 milligrams twice
a day , and KCL , 40 milligrams each day. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed
the patient lives with his wife , he is an exposed smoker and
occasional ethanol drinker. He is retired secondary to his
cardiomyopathy. He was able to ambulate and play golf prior to the
coronary artery bypass grafting in October .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was uncomfortable , tachypneic.
Vital signs were temperature 100.7 , heart
rate 97 , blood pressure 108/67 , 96% oxygen saturation on 4 liters
by nasal cannula. Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination
showed extraocular movements were intact , pupils equal , round ,
reactive to light , oropharynx benign. Neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy. Chest showed left base bronchial breath sounds
with egophony , with a few scattered wheezes throughout.
Cardiovascular examination showed JVP approximately 8 centimeters ,
carotids were I+ bilaterally , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 , S2 , very distant heart sounds. The liver edge was palpable.
Abdomen was nontender , positive bowel sounds. Skin showed the
upper chest wound where debridement had taken place , approximately
6 centimeters long at the incisional site , which was slightly
tender and erythematous. Back showed no costovertebral angle
tenderness. Extremities showed the patient had TEDS stockings on ,
there was trace edema , II+ pulses bilaterally. Neurologic
examination showed the patient was alert and oriented , fluent , and
the examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , SMA-7 showed sodium 135 ,
potassium 5.1 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate
22 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 128. CK was 13 , triponin 0.0.
Prothrombin time was 14.1 , partial thromboplastin time 27.5.
Digoxin level was 0.6. Complete blood count showed white blood
count 7.8 , differential 69 neutrophils , 16 lymphs , 7 monos , 8
eosinophils , hematocrit 28.7 , platelets 735 , 000. Sputum from
27 of January showed 4+ Hemophilus influenza , which was pan sensitive.
Chest x-ray on the date of admission showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate with possible effusion. Electrocardiogram showed left
bundle branch block. VQ scan was low probability.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Infectious disease. The patient had a
maximum temperature of 102.3 on 27 of February He was
on vancomycin , gentamicin and ceftazidime. On 13 of June , gentamicin
and ceftazidime were discontinued , and ofloxacin was started
secondary to decreasing creatinine. After his temperature spike on
21 of August , the patient's maximum temperature declined each of the
following days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. The
sternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued on
vancomycin for the coagulase negative Staphylococcus that grew from
the wound site on 15 of May The patient had a computerized
tomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternal
wound site and no abscess was seen. Thoracentesis was done on the
left pleural effusion , and the tap was an exudate with pH 7.51 ,
glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , LDH 38. There were 756
white blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%
mesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid was
grossly blood. Cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteria
and fungal growth. Gram stain showed no organisms , no
polymorphonuclear cells. Vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48
hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. Given
his recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will be
continued for 2 weeks after discharge. Ofloxacin will also be
continued for the same. All cultures from this hospitalization are
negative to date.
2. Cardiovascular. The patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction. VQ scan was low probability on admission. This was
performed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. Lower extremity
noninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative for
deep vein thrombosis. The patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.
The patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initial
dyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestive
heart failure. His admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , and
weight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. With aggressive diuresis
during hospitalization , Lasix was discontinued on the day prior to
discharge. Digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was
1.0. The patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolic
blood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. Captopril and
Lopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during his
hospitalization. On discharge , he was on a stable dose of
Captopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and Lopressor , 12.5
milligrams twice a day. He was not orthostatic on the day prior to
discharge.
3. Renal. The patient was aggressively diuresed. His BUN and
creatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and
2.6 on 20 of November Subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on
9 of July , BUN was 37 , creatinine 2.2. The patient had an
eosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of March , and subsequently
decreased to 11% on discharge. Urine eosinophils were not present.
It appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , which
was discontinued on 24 of January It is unlikely that his increasing
renal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. More
likely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken to
decrease his congestive heart failure. Follow-up laboratory values
will likely reveal improvement in BUN and creatinine status , as
well as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.
4. Psychiatry. The patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,
and has been treated successfully with Ativan , but Serax resulted
in nightmares. The patient has a history of depression and may
benefit from counseling. The patient's decreased oral intake ,
nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlying
depressive component over his prolonged illness.
5. Endocrine. The patient's blood sugar levels have been well
controlled on a regimen of NPH , 20 each morning. He has not
required any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage has
been discontinued for 2 days.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is fair. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE are Tylenol , 650 milligrams by mouth every
4 hours as needed for headache , enteric-coated aspirin , 325
milligrams by mouth each day , Captopril , 6.25 milligrams by mouth
every 8 hours , held if systolic blood pressure is less than 85 ,
digoxin , 0.125 milligrams by mouth each day , Benadryl , 25 to 50
milligrams by mouth every 4 hours as needed for itching , Colace ,
100 milligrams by mouth twice a day , NPH insulin , 20 units
subcutaneously each morning , Atrovent inhaler , 2 puffs 4 times a
day , Ativan , 0.5 to 1 milligram by mouth every 6 hours as needed
for anxiety and insomnia , Lopressor , 12.5 milligrams by mouth twice
a day , held for systolic blood pressure less than 80 or heart rate
less than 60 , Niferex , 150 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Percocet , 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain ,
Sarna lotion topically to back as needed , vancomycin , 1 gram
intravenously every 48 hours times 10 days , Axid , 150 milligrams by
mouth twice a day , ofloxacin , 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day
times 7 days.
The patient will be transferred to Tipalms Hospital
on 5 of September He will have a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. Schwerd
in approximately 2 weeks.
