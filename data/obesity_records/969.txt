HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. The patient was in end-stage renal disease and had a living
unrelated renal transplant from his friend. A detailed
description of the procedure can be found in his dictated
operative report. There were no complications. His kidney had
good urine output during his postoperative course. His
creatinine continued to trend down even on his days of discharge.
His creatinine was within a normal range prior to his discharge.
He had some volume overload secondary to the large amount of IV
fluids that he received , however , after minimal diuresis he
responded with high urine outputs. His immunosuppression
included Thymoglobulin , tacrolimus , a steroid taper , and
CellCept. His allograft was functioning well.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation postoperatively. He was evaluated by the Cardiology
Service. They interrogated his pacer and found that he was in
fact in atrial fibrillation. After 48 hours , the Cardiology
Service considered anticoagulation. Because he had a history of
a GI bleed , it was decided that he would not undergo
anticoagulation. The patient's heart rate throughout this period
was within the normal range because he was V-paced.
