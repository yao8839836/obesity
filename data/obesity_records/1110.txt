Discharge Date: 5/21/2006
ATTENDING: MCMILLAN , TWILA M.D.
PERSONAL PHYSICIAN: Mariah Semetara , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Lower gastrointestinal bleed.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Endstage renal disease , hemodialysis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old male with endstage renal
disease , on hemodialysis and prior peptic
ulcer disease , who underwent EGD and colonoscopy four days prior to
arrival for evaluation of guaiac-positive stool. He underwent
polypectomy at that time without complication , but on the day of
admission noted bright red blood per rectum. Additionally he felt weak and
lightheaded and presented to the ED where his initial vital signs showed a
blood pressure 105/48 and heart rate of 60. He subsequently
became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
Labs showed a hematocrit of 28 , down from a prior hematocrit of
43 in April . He was given a liter of IV fluids with moderate
improvement and was evaluated by the GI Service. GI at that time
felt the source was most likely secondary to the polypectomy
site. He was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring with a
planned colonoscopy the following day.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. End-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis with a history of
several failed grafts and shunts , currently using a left lower
extremity shunt.
2. Pelvic ulcer disease , status post partial gastrectomy with a
Billroth I in 1960 and upper GI bleed in 1996.
3. History of a bezoar.
4. Mild mental retardation.
5. Sick sinus syndrome , status post pacemaker.
6. Hepatitis C.
7. Hypertension.
8. Paranoid schizophrenia.
9. Hyperparathyroid status post partial thyroidectomy.
10. Seizure.
11. SVT.
12. Hemodialysis-related hypotension.
13. Anemia with elevated MCV.
OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg
daily , Cardura 4 mg daily , Nephrocaps one p.o. daily , calcium
carbonate 500 mg three times a day , Renagel 800 mg three times a

1 mg p.o. daily , Risperdal 1 mg at bedtime , Zyprexa 5 mg at
bedtime , Zoloft 15 mg daily , Colace 100 mg twice a day , Protonix
40 mg daily.
ALLERGIES: No known allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his cousin Kathyrn Rude who is his
healthcare proxy.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Afebrile , heart rate 80 , blood pressure
127/64 , O2 saturation 100% on 2 liters , breathing 12 times a
minute , alert and oriented x2 in no acute distress. Neck:
Supple neck with a thyroidectomy scar. Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm
without murmur , rubs or gallops. JVP 9. AV fistula in the
bilateral upper and lower extremities with no thrill or bruit.
Abdomen: Obese , soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel
sounds. Neurologic: Slow , responsive , but appropriate , moving
all extremities , ambulatory. Digital rectal examination positive
for blood.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES: Notable for a potassium of 5.3 ,
BUN of 79 , creatinine of 10.3 , lactic acid 1.5 , WBCs of 5 ,
hematocrit of 28.7 , platelets of 162.
PROCEDURES: Colonoscopy with embolization of the ileocecal
artery on 1/6/2006 , repeat colonoscopy on 10/6/2006.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
GI: The patient was admitted to the MICU following presentation
to the emergency room with bright red blood per rectum and a
hematocrit of 28. Over the first couple of days in intensive
care , he received 8 to 9 units of packed red blood cells and On hospital day
#2 , he underwent an embolization of the ileocecal artery with subsequent
improvement in clinical picture. Over the next couple of days , he continued to
have
guaiac-positive and melena stools but with stabilization in his
hematocrit. A repeat colonoscopy was completed on 11/22/2006 ,
which showed a single white ulcer in the colon thought to be the
old polypectomy site but no signs of new or old blood.
Throughout the rest of his hospitalization , his hematocrit
remained stable and he was maintained on PPIs twice a day.
Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis three times a week. This was continued during his
hospitalization. He has had recurrent issues with AV fistula
failure. On admission , he was relying on the left lower
extremity shunt. There was a hardened area proximal to the shunt
found on physical exam and an absence of a thrill at
the site. Per Renal recommendation , this was evaluated
with an AV fistulogram and a subsequent ultrasound. The
ultrasound revealed that there was complex fluid collection
proximal to his AV graft. He was evaluated by Surgery who did
not feel further workup was indicated at this time. The patient
will be discharged to resume his routine renal regimen.
Psych: The patient has a history of schizophrenia and mild
mental retardation. We continued his outpatient psychiatric
medications. There were no acute issues.
Heme: The patient has a chronic anemia with a high MCV. Iron
studies suggest an anemia of chronic disease. He will be
discharged on his preadmission medications of B12 , folate and
iron once a day. His hematocrit has remained in the mid 30s.
Cardiovascular: There were no acute issues during his initial
hospitalization when he was hypotensive secondary to GI bleed.
His home beta-blocker was held. This was restarted prior to
discharge without incident. His Cardura was not restarted and
the patient did not become hypertensive. He will be discharged
without it. Additionally , we are holding his aspirin at
discharge until his followup primary care appointment.
Prophylaxis: pneumoboots; ambulation and
twice-a-day proton pump inhibitor.
FEN: Renal diet.
DISPOSITION: The patient was being discharged home. He was seen
and evaluated by Physical Therapy who felt that this would be a
safe disposition plan.
CODE: He was a full code.
