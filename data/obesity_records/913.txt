ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Ms. Bicknese it was a pleasure to take care of you during your
hospitalization. We have made some changes to your medications. We
increased your blood pressure medication: Lisinopril from 5mg to 15mg
once a day. We started you on a medication for anemia: ferrous
gluconate which you should take 3 times a day along with colace a stool
softener which you should take twice a day. We also increased your lasix
frm 20mg once a day to 40mg twice a day. As discussed with you , your
echocardiogram ( ultrasound of your heart ) showed that you had some
abnormality with the functioning of your heart which may in part explain
your shortness of breath especially on exertion. It is extremely important
to follow up with your primary care physician Dr. Aprea appt 7/12 at
12:10pm and your cardiologist Dr. Reedy on 2/16 at 1:30pm. If you
have trouble breathing , have chest pain please seek medical attention as
soon as possible.
