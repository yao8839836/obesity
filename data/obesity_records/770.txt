BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

cardiac RF ( HTN , DM2 , HChol , recent smoker , Fam Hx ) , also with hiatal
hernia , ?breast cysts , chronic pain syndrome. Pt presents with stabbing
chest pain with radiation down L arm ( which is unlike her anginal CP ) ,
feeling of chest "tightness" and ?diaphoresis and SOB. This pain has been
persistent for 1.5 weeks , worsening/persistent x 24 hours.
*PMH: CAD s/p PCI 1992 , HTN , DM , dyslipidemia , gastritis , depression , OA ,

*ALLERGIES: erythromycin , pcn , motrin?
*SH: d/c smoking 3 yrs ago , no etoh , no ivdu/recreational drugs , lives with

*PE on admission: remarkable for marked chest wall tenderness , and mild
fluid overload by JVP of ~10cm , S4 on cardiac auscultation , 1+ peripheral
edema , and dyspnea with occasional expiratory wheezing.
*LABS/STUDIES: Admission studies showed BNP of 809; CXR wnl , EKG unchanged
from previous , negative cardiac enzymes x3.
**********HOSPITAL COURSE************
*Chest discomfort: It was felt that her chest symptoms were not angina but
possibly represented bronchospasm , or fluid overload secondary to
diastolic dysfunction. TTE was therefore performed on 6/21 and showed ED
60% , LVH , and small area of HK on inferior wall. Dipyridamole-PET done
4/19 showed small severe fixed perfusion defect in inferior wall , but was
otherwise unremarkable. Given the patient's fluid overload and possible
diastolic dysfunction , she was given a total of 60 mg IV Lasix and over
10/13/4 diuresed approximately 1 L negative. Clinical improvement was
observed on 6/10 To treat possible bronchospasm she was given
atrovent/albuterol by MDI qid. On 11/16 improvement was noted with respect
to her dyspnea , wheezing , and chest "tightness" , and she was switched to
po Lasix 80 mg. She was discharged with instructions to monitor daily
weights and take po Lasix 40 mg , with followup with her PCP/outpatient
cardiologist Dr. Woller
*Secondary prevention: the patient's admission lipid profile returned LDL
of 107; her statin dose was increased to Simvastatin 80 mg ( and she was
discharged with Lipitor 40 mg ). Her blood pressure remained within
normal limits after increasing her lisinopril dose to 40 bid , she was
discharged with this new dose. The patient remained on telemetry over
her hospital course with no issues.
*Anemia: The patient's admission Hct was 32.8 ( baseline of 40 ) and the
patient was asymptomatic from this standpoint. Iron studies were sent and
showed low-normal serum iron of 38 , with iron sat of 12%. She was
discharged with Niferex 150 mg bid and ascorbic acid 500 mg bid x 1month ,
to be followed up with her PCP.
*Pain: Throughout her hospital course , the patient's chronic pain ,
headache , and chest pain was managed with her home regimen of Percocet
5/325 qid and acetaminophen prn.
*Endo: Her blood sugars remained in excellent control with home dose of
Avandia 8 bid. A mildly enlarged thyroid was noted but her TSH was wnl at
0.715.
