Discharge Date: 5/2/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND LOWER EXTREMITY SWELLING.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old male with
history of diabetes and ischemic
cardiomyopathy who presents on 11/26/01 with increased shortness of
breath and fatigue. His cardiac history began in 1980 , when he
suffered from an myocardial infarction and had a second myocardial
infarction in 1986. He had a 3 vessel coronary artery bypass graft
in 1987 with a LIMA-left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft
to OM and saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The patient developed
decreasing functional status postoperatively and recent
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.
In October 2000 , Mr. Rinaldo was admitted to the Pagham University Of with chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed native 3
vessel disease with occlusion of his venous graft to his obtuse
marginal and posterior descending arteries. On that admission , Mr.
Rinaldo was aggressively diuresed and post discharge , he was able to
complete his normal activities of daily living with no shortness of
breath or chest pain. Over the several months prior to admission ,
however , Mr. Rinaldo noted progressive worsening of shortness of
breath , dyspnea on exertion and fatigue , such that , on the day of
admission , he reported that he could not walk from his driveway to
his house without symptoms. He reported no baseline orthopnea , but
states he does have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
history of gallstones , hypothyroidism ,
nephrolithiasis , cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant only for the coronary artery
bypass graft in 1987.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of an myocardial infarction in his
50s. His mother also died of an myocardial
infarction in her 70s.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Captopril 37.5 t.i.d. 2. Isordil
30 t.i.d. 3. Digoxin .125 q. day. 4.
Synthroid .25 q. day. 5. Lipitor 20 q. day. 6. Torsemide 80
b.i.d. 7. Coumadin 4 mg Monday/Wednesday/Friday , 5 mg other days.
8. NPH 40 units b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 97 , pulse 69 ,
blood pressure 100/70 , respiratory rate 16 ,
satting 92% on room air. Neck examination revealed jugular venous
pressure , elevated behind the ear and approximately 27 mm with
positive hepatojugular reflux. The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination revealed
regular rate and rhythm with frequent ectopy , positive S3 and PMI
in the midaxillary line. Abdomen was benign. Extremities showed
no lower extremity edema with 1+ distal pulses and warm to the
touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a sodium of 146 , BUN 16 ,
creatinine 1.3 , hematocrit 36 , INR 1.4.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 67 with left axis deviation ,
right bundle branch block and Q-waves in leads 2 , 3 and AVF.
Chest x-ray revealed no pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Au Ri
service for diuresis and possible inotrope
support. He was diuresed over the course of 10 days using
Torsemide 80 mg IV t.i.d. and his Captopril was gradually increased
as tolerated to a maximum dose of 75 mg t.i.d. The patient
diuresed without difficulty and by the time of discharge , he had
weighed a dry weight of approximately 96 kilograms.
The patient was also evaluated for possible heart transplant.
Work-up was extensive and included an echocardiogram on 11/20/01 ,
which showed an ejection fraction of 15-20% with global hypokinesis
and akinesis of the inferior septal walls with moderate mitral
regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Abdominal
ultrasound on 11/20/01 , revealed probable cardiac cirrhosis. A
liver spleen scan on 10/1/01 , was consistent with mild cardiac
cirrhosis , as was an MRI of the liver on 4/24/01 .  As a result ,
the patient was not considered a candidate for transplant.
Pulmonary function tests on 4/10/01 , revealed a DLCO = 14 , which
was 49% of expected. On 3/20/01 , the patient underwent a
dobutamine MIBI stress test that was consistent with a moderately
enlarged area of prior myocardial infarction of the left circumflex
territory and posterior descending artery territories. The
examination was also suggestive with an area of modest dobutamine
induced ischemia in the territory of the left anterior descending
with preserved viability.
Endocrine wise , the patient's diabetes was managed in-house on a
regular insulin sliding scale. Because his hemoglobin A1C level
was below 6 on discharge , he was placed back on his regiment of NPH
40 units b.i.d. In terms of his thyroid , we made no adjustments to
his Levoxyl regiment. He has been coumadinized for a low ejection
fraction and was discharged on his regular regiment of 4 mg
Monday/Wednesday/Friday and 5 mg on all other days.
The patient also has a history of depression and he was maintained
on Prozac 20 mg q. day.
Hematologically , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 36
during his hospitalization. His MCV = 75.1 in a 61-year-old male
with necrocytic anemia. We obtained a colonoscopy which revealed
polyps , all of which were snagged with no complications. The
pathologies are currently pending.
The patient was discharged on 7/15/01 , having diuresed to a dry
weight of 96 kilograms and plan to follow-up with Dr. Board on
7/30/01 .
