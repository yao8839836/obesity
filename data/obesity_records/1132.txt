CT I-:
Small left putamminal bleed extending above l-thalamus. Small amount of
blood in left occipital horn. Stable compared to CT at NVH
A/P:
82 yo RHM with h/o HTN , DM-2 , CAD and AVR ( on coumadin until 9/22 )
was last seen normal when went to nap this afternoon at 12:45pm. At
2:30pm woke up dysarthric , mild RUE weakness. His wife noticed slowing
and confusion. Head CT at NVH ( repeated here ) showed small left BG bleed ,
extending to left lateral ( occipital horn ). Given location , most likely
hypertensive bleed. Cannot rule out underlying small stroke. Given h/o
AVR will r/o endocarditis as well. Plan
1. admit to NICU. When transfer to the floor LMC
2. BP control with home regimen. keep SBP&lt;140
3. Hold ASA. Continue holding coumadin , clarify indication in
the future
4. Hold metformin for now ( in case needs CT/A ) , add insulin
sliding scale
Brief Hospital Course:
The hemorrhage was stable on follow-up imaging. INR was 1.1.
Neurologic exam was stable , with persistent dysarthria , right pronator
drift , and mild right leg weakness. Patient evaluated by PT/OT and
deemed appropriate candidate for acute rehab.
Cardiovascular: Continued to be in atrial fibrillation. Pacemaker was
firing , but on 5/25 pm had an episode of hr 30's x few seconds , and for
rest of night hr 40's - 50's. EKG unchanged from admission - atrial
fibrillation , left anterior fascicular block , some pvc's. Consulted
LMC Cardiology , who analyzed the telemetry and found that bradycardic
readings were artifactual. There was no EKG obtained during bradycardia
and no documented physical exam findings to suggest bradycardia.
Cardiology felt there was no other evidence of pacer malfunction.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up with outpatient cardiologist , neurologist , and PCP.
