Discharge Date: 5/12/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman
who is admitted for aortic valve
replacement on August , 2002. He has has asymptomatic aortic
stenosis. He also has known coronary artery disease having
undergone angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary
artery in 1991. Catheterization at that time demonstrated an 80%
left anterior descending lesion and a 60% first diagonal lesion.
He has had a 4-5 year history of shortness of breath diagnosed with
mild aortic stenosis and followed clinically. In the planning
process for knee surgery , serial echocardiograms were performed
showing decreased aortic valve area and decreasing ejection
fraction. Most recent echocardiogram shows moderate to severe
aortic stenosis and has been suggested to have the valve replaced
before undergoing knee surgery. The patient was admitted for
elective aortic valve replacement prior to knee surgery. He has a
history of class II heart failure , slight limitation of physical
activity. He is in normal sinus rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , degenerative
joint disease of the bilateral knees , left greater than right ,
status post left total knee replacement in 1994 with persistent
symptoms to undergo surgery for his knee , benign prostatic
hypertrophy , decreasing hearing , left greater than right.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: A total knee replacement in 1994 ,
appendectomy in the 1960s.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Diltiazem ER 180 mg once a day , Isordil
30 mg three times a day , enteric coated
aspirin 325 mg once a day , Zocor 10 mg once a day , Cozaar 25 mg
once a day , Humulin N 30 units in the morning and 14 units in the
evening.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate 80 and regular.
HEENT: Dentition is without evidence of
infection. NECK: No carotid bruits were heard. CHEST: Clear.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. He has a systolic ejection murmur
at 3/6 in the aortic area radiating to the carotids. ABDOMEN:
Soft and non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Left total knee replacement
incision , no varicose veins. NEUROLOGICAL: Intact.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission include a BUN of 13 ,
creatinine 1.3 , white blood cell count 6.0 , hematocrit
40.7. His echocardiogram performed on June , 2001 demonstrated
an TPP Hospital65% , aortic stenosis with a mean gradient
of 42 mm Hg , peak gradient of 63 mm Hg , calculated valve area of
0.9 cm squared with mild mitral insufficiency , trivial
insufficiency and a mildly dilated left atrium. EKG shows normal
sinus rhythm at 88. Chest x-ray is clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent coronary arteriography on
August , 2002 at Pagham University Of .
This examination showed a right dominant system with a diffuse 40%
lesion of the left main , discrete 50% lesion of his proximal left
anterior descending coronary artery , a 70% lesion of his mid left
anterior descending artery with an 80% distal lesion. He also had
an 80% lesion of his first diagonal and a diffuse 50% proximal
lesion of the same vessel , 70% ostial lesion of his circumflex and
an eccentric 45% lesion of his right coronary artery with a 70%
lesion in his large left ventricular branch. The patient went to
the operating room on August , 2002 where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a #23 Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve
and a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the first marginal and saphenous vein graft
to the posterior left ventricular branch. His intraoperative
course was uneventful. He was seen in consultation by the Diabetic
Management Service for blood sugar control and initiation into the
Portland Protocol for intravenous insulin. His postoperative
course was complicated by an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation
which was treated with replacement of his electrolytes and
initiation of Lopressor therapy and also mild anemia that was
monitored and addressed with diuresis for fluid overload. His
postoperative course was uneventful. He continued to require
diuresis for pleural effusion. Chest x-ray on discharge
demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions. His hematocrit on
discharge is 25.6. At this point in time , there is no need to
transfuse the patient. He is stable. Heart rate is stable. He is
on room air oxygenating at 97%. He is to be discharged to
rehabilitation on the following medications.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Colace 100 mg three times a day ,
albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. ,
Atrovent 0.5 mg q.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg twice a day , Lopressor 50 mg
three times a day , Lasix 40 mg once a day , enteric coated aspirin
325 mg once a day , simvastatin 20 mg at h.s. , potassium replacement
20 mEq once a day , CZI scale , NPH insulin 20 units in the morning
and 10 units pre-dinner.
FOLLOW UP: The patient is to be discharged to the care of Dr.
