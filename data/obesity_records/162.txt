SERVICE: GMS Eans
ATTENDING: Dr. Lindy Cadoff
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: AFib with LVR , CHF.
ASSOCIATE DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: History of AFib , hypertension ,
diabetes , CHF , pulmonary hypertension , COPD , asthma and chronic
renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine 2.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Dyspnea and hypoxia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 80-year-old female with
history of AFib , atrial flutter , hypertension , diabetes , CHF ,
pulmonary hypertension , COPD and CRI at baseline of 2 who
recently discharged from Stusri Medical Center for CHF. Prior to this
admission , the patient was at baseline Class III heart failure
with dyspnea on exertion at about 20 feet. Following the CHF
admission , the patient is on 2 liter home O2 and stated she had
been stable for about a week , but able to do her chores with 2
liter O2. Had been fully at home VNA and saw her PCP on the day
prior to admission without any change in her status. On the
night prior to admission , however , she stated she had heart
raising and could not sleep. Overnight , she had increased
shortness of breath , but without any chest pain or
lightheadedness. Daughter called in the morning and saw the
patient with increasing oxygen requirement to 3 liter and called
VNA who noted her sat in 80s on 4 liter and told the patient to
come into the hospital. The patient stated that she has been
tried to stick to her low-sodium diet and taking the home
medication. Of note , the patient has been taking double dose of
Sunday meds. Denies fever , chills , chest pain and worsen cough.
She has baseline cough with white sputum production. In ED , the
patient was sating at 99% on non-rebreather. Has AFib with rate
in the 70 and temperature is 98. Her BUN was elevated. EKG
unchanged. The patient received Lasix 40 IV x1 and admitted.

inversion in I , II , aVL , aVF , V6 otherwise uncharged. Chest
x-ray bilateral infiltrate , left greater than right effusion.
TTE on 5/22 , decreased LV size , ejection fraction 80% , no wall
motion abnormality , normal RV , moderate LAE , trace MR , TR ,
hypodynamic heart , PA systolic pressure at 38.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is an 80 years old female with history
of AFib and CHF , diastolic dysfunction with EF of 80% and COPD
who was recently discharged for CHF w low dose lasix of 20mg now
is found to be in CHF in a setting with suspected AFib with LVR.
The patient also had acute on chronic renal insufficiency likely
secondary to low flow from her volume status. The patient was
admitted for diuresis and for the rate control.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Ischemia: There is no evidence of ischemia. The patient was
ruled out with serial enzymes. She was continued on aspirin , no
betablocker , and short acting diltiazem and statin. Her
beta-blocker was initially not initiated , however , on three days
prior to discharge , she was started on short-dose beta-blockade
due to hypertension. She tolerated that reasonably well ,
however , did have episodes of bradycardia to 40s. Decision was
reached to defer starting betablockade on her until her
appointment with her cardiologist. Her BB was discontinued.
Pump: The patient was volume over loaded on chest x-ray with BNP
greater than 500. The patient has EF of 80% with hypodynamic
heart. The patient was diuresing initially with 80 IV Lasix and
subsequently increased to 120 b.i.d. of IV Lasix. She was
diuresed slowly at about 500 mL everyday. Ultimately , her Lasix
was switched over to 160 p.o. b.i.d. with very good diuresis , but
her creatinine was elevated , prompting decreasing her Lasix back
down to 120 p.o. b.i.d. She will continue on this dose on
discharge and has a followup with her primary care physician for
creatinine trial and make sure that her creatinine is trending
down. We did not want to over diuresis the patient given her
volume dependence and the diastolic dysfunction especially as we
suspect that the heart failure is secondary to her rhythm , but
not really significant volume overload. She had a repeat chest
x-ray three days prior to admission , which shows slightly
improving pulmonary edema and pulmonary effusion. She was to
repeat lytes and her creatinine was followed very closely.
Rhythm: She was in afib w RVR initially. The patient was
started on diltiazem t.i.d. We hold her dig initially as her
level was elevated to 2.4 eventually. Her dig was restarted at
0.125 mg p.o. every three days. Her dig level will need to be
followed as an outpatient. Her dig was stable on this particular
dose. We also started her on short acting beta-blocker with
Lopressor at 6.25 t.i.d. She will be reduced to 6.25 b.i.d. on
discharge. The patient tolerated the Lopressor though had a few
episodes of bradycardia. BB was d/c on discharge.
Pulmonary: The patient has shortness of breath , despite
secondary to CHF and COPD. The patient was given nebs and her
Advair. She was on 4 liter of oxygen on discharge and she will
be self-weaned at home to 2 liter as possible.
Heme: She has chronic baseline shortness of breath. She was
continued on her Coumadin for anticoagulation. INR was stable
throughout the hospital stay.
Renal: Has acute renal insufficiency on chronic renal
insufficiency. Her Avapro was held initially. Suspect that her
acute renal insufficiency is secondary to poor flow in the
setting of AFib and atrial flutter and failure. Her renal
function actually improved slightly upon diuresis , however , she
bumped her creatinine slightly on discharge secondary to
high-dose Lasix. Her Lasix will be decreased to 120 b.i.d. p.o.
on discharge and her creatinine will be checked two days after
discharge.
ID: No evidence of infection. She has some sputum that was sent
with normal flora. Blood culture and urine culture was negative.
Chest PA and lateral was also negative for any evidence of
consolidation or infection.
FEN: She was kept on the low-salt ADA diet , cardiac diet with K
and mag repletion.
Prophylasix: Pt was anticoagulated with Coumadin and also on a
PPI.
CODE STATUS: She was full code.
DISPOSITION: She is to follow up with her primary care physician
and also cardiologist. She has appointment Dr. Wurth on
3/24/2006 at 2:40 p.m. and Dr. Theiling , the cardiologist on
2/25/2006 at 8:40 a.m.
DISCHARGE MEDICATION: She is on aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , DuoNeb
3/0.5 neb q.6h. , Fosamax 70 mg p.o. every week , Tessalon Perles
100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. , digoxin 0.125 p.o. every three days ,
diltiazem extended release 120 mg p.o. daily , iron sulfate 325 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Advair 250/50 one puff
b.i.d. , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin NPH 26 q.a.m. and 16
q.p.m. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. daily , lovastatin 20 mg p.o. at bedtime ,
and omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily.
