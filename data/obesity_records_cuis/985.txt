Discharge Date: 2/10/1994
PROBLEMS: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND
STATUS POST ANGIOPLASTY OF RIGHT
CORONARY ARTERY AND LEFT
CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. HIGH CHOLESTEROL.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year white female
with history of positive exercise
tolerance test MIBI , now presents after 12 hours of stuttering
chest pain. Cardiac risk factors include hypertension and high
cholesterol of 220 to 270's. The patient was generally well until
October 1991 she had an episode of chest pressure. This was a
single episode. On October 1991 , the patient had continued chest
pressure. She had exercise tolerance test MIBI for which she went
3 minutes and 37 seconds with a positive left bundle branch block 3
minutes into exercise. Her MIBI showed a reperfusion defect
anteriorly , inferiorly and septal. A decision was made to
medically manage the patient with beta blockers and sublingual
Nitroglycerins. During this exercise tolerance test MIBI , she was
also noted to have 1 to 2 mm ST depressions in multiple leads. The
patient was active and pain-free until at 10:00 p.m. one day prior
to admission , while walking , she developed pressure across the
chest and between her shoulder blades. She had no shortness of
breath , diaphoresis , nausea or vomiting or light-headedness. She
had no palpitations. She took 100 mg of Atenolol with some relief
and went to bed. On the day of admission at 6:30 a.m. , the patient
awoke with chest pain. She checked her blood pressure at home
which was approximately 200/100. She took 100 mg of Atenolol.
Initially , she had increasing chest pain and then this resolved by
approximately 10:30 a.m. She went to the Emergency Room at 1:00
p.m. She described this pain as the same pain that she had in
1991. She did not take any Nitroglycerin because her prescription
was expired. She has had no history of orthopnea , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea or pedal edema. She has no history of chest
pain. She has a history of shortness of breath after walking
upstairs. In the Emergency Room , she was given one Aspirin and she
was also started on Nitropaste. She was given Nifedipine 10 mg PO
x 1. Her blood pressure decreased from 190/100 to 114/76. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Cardiac. As above. ( 2 ) Increase in blood
pressure. ( 3 ) Left breast cancer in September 1987 , status post
lumpectomy with negative margins. No XRT. She is followed by Dr.
Binney Her mammography on August 1993 was negative per the
patient at Norap Valley Hospital . ( 4 ) Intermittent left bundle branch
block. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the
patient was on Atenolol 100 mg q.d. x two extra doses in the last
24 hours. This was decreased down to 50 mg every day.
Hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. Multivitamins with Iron.
Sublingual Nitroglycerin prescribed but never taken by the patient.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient
lives with her husband. She has six kids and nine grandchildren.
She is a retired Medical Technician. She has no history of smoking
or alcohol. FAMILY HISTORY: No coronary artery disease. Her
mother had ovarian cancer and died at the age of 80. Her father
died of leukemia. She has no history of breast cancer in her
family.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese elderly female
who is comfortable. Blood pressure is
114/76 and 150/100. Temperature 97.3. Heart rate 60. Respiratory
rate 16 , 96% on room air saturation. HEENT: Pupils equal , round
and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were
intact. Oropharynx benign. Neck: No jugular venous distention.
Carotids 2+ without bruits. No lymphadenopathy. Lungs: Trace
bibasilar rales. Heart regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs ,
gallops or rubs. Abdomen soft , non-tender , positive bowel sounds.
No bruits. Groin: Femoral pulses 2+ without bruits. Extremities:
1+ pitting edema bilaterally and 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses. Neurological nonfocal. Rectal examination guaiac
negative per Emergency Ward.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory examinations on admission
revealed SMA-7 within normal limits.
SMA-20 was notable for calcium of 10.2 and cholesterol of 284 ,
triglycerides 271. WBC was 9. Hematocrit of 48. Platelets 294.
MCV 87. Polys 76. Urinalysis negative. Chest x-ray with no
infiltrates or effusion. EKG showed sinus bradycardia , 84 rate.
Intervals were .19 , .08 and .45. Axes 15 degrees. The patient had
Q-waves in Leads 3 and F , biphasic T's in Leads 1 , L and 2 , flat
T-waves in 3 and F , biphasics in V1 through 6. Old EKG not
available but by report is similar.
HOSPITAL COURSE: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease , status post
angioplasty. The patient is a 70 year
old female admitted with approximately 12 hours of chest pain. She
ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a CPK peak of 786 and MB
fraction of 52. Her echocardiogram examination was within normal
limits with left ventricular function that was normal. She did ,
however , have inferior posterior hypokinesis. Her ejection
fraction was 55%. The patient was on IV Heparin , Aspirin and
Nitropaste as well as a beta blocker. She had no symptoms of chest
pain or shortness of breath. She had exercise tolerance test which
was done approximately 5 to 6 days after her myocardial infarction.
She underwent a modified Bruce protocol for 8 minutes and 40
seconds with chest pain and ST changes. She had 1 minute of left
bundle branch block at the end of her exercise test. The patient's
exercise test was also notable for her having typical chest pain
similar to her angina. She had up to 2 mm ST depressions. The
test was highly predictive of significant coronary disease. This
exercise test was done on March . The patient went to cardiac
catheterization on May . During this , she was noted to have
significant coronary artery disease. Her second diagonal had a 50%
proximal stenosis. Her mid left anterior descending showed 40%
stenosis. Her first obtuse marginal had 50% proximal stenosis.
Her most distal large obtuse marginal has a 100% stenosis and fills
by left to left bridging collaterals and right to left collaterals.
Her right coronary artery has a 50% proximal stenosis followed by
70% mid stenosis. Her left ventriculogram shows mild inferior ,
posterior hypokinesis with overall preserved chamber size and
function. The calculated ejection fraction was 67%. On October , the patient returned to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory
for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of her right
coronary artery lesion which was 60 to 40% proximally and 80 to 20%
distally. She also had percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of her left circumflex of 100% to 20%. Her sheaths
were removed on April in the morning. The patient was
discharged on April with no further complaints of chest pain.
She was not started on Ace inhibitors because her ejection fraction
was very good. She was continued on her beta blocker and Isordil.
The dietician saw the patient with regards to her diet because of
her high cholesterol. She also had post myocardial infarction
teaching done. She will be followed with Cardiac Rehabilitation at
Abois Che Memorial Hospital ( 2 ) Hypertension. The patient had good
control of her hypertension with Procardia. ( 3 ) High cholesterol.
The patient had cholesterol of 239 with HDL 43 , LDL 158. She had
dietician state to her with regards to her high cholesterol ,
however , if this does not work , the patient should be started on acholesterol l
owering medication as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of
discharge , the patient was on Aspirin PO every day , Atenolol 100 mg
PO q.day , Isordil 30 mg PO t.i.d. , Nifedipine XL 30 mg q.d. PO ,
Nitroglycerin prn. DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to
home. FOLLOW-UP CARE: She will be followed by Cardiac
Rehabilitation at Mi Lakeield Sonme She will be followed by Dr. Annette Schoultz in approximately one month. She should have an exercise
tolerance test in three weeks and also have her cholesterol checked
at this time. She will also have a follow-up appointment with Dr.
Rossie Mankoski of Cardiology in approximately two weeks. DIET:
She is suggested to have a low cholesterol , low saturated fat diet.
