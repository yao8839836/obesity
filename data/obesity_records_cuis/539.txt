HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55 year old male
with a history of asthma , chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and a significant psychiatric history
including mania , depression and psychosis.
His cardiac risk factors include hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use ,
family history. He does not have diabetes mellitus , although he
has had chemical diabetes mellitus in the past while on steroids.
He has been hypertensive.
He is transferred from Darnla Nashris Doweeksbar County Memorial Hospital with questionable
chest pain during the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
bronchitis flare. In 10 of January he had an asthma flare. He had a
respiratory arrest with intubation. Catheterization at that time
showed a 40% LAD lesion. His wedge pressure was 20 mmHg. He had
normal LV function on LV gram at that time. In 11 of March he had a
nonQ-wave myocardial infarction with CKs approximately 300. In
2 of July he had another nonQ-wave myocardial infarction. CK is
approximately 700. In 7 of March he had an exercise tolerance test in
which he went nine minutes. He had 1 mm ST depression in 2 , 3 and
F. He reached maximum heart rate of 137 , blood pressure 186/80.
Since that time he has had multiple , multiple admissions for asthma
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flares and rule out for
myocardial infarction; each time ruling out. In 28 of May he was in the
emergency room with vasovagal episode , treated with atropine. In
12 of November he had an exercise tolerance test with thallium of which he
underwent four minutes. He had a blood pressure of 164/80. He did
not have any chest pain , ectopy or evidence of ischemia on EKG ,
although there was questionable old infarct or ischemia at the apex
on the thallium images. In 9 of February he had a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare. He went to Akcare Hospital .  He had a
chest pain. He refused cardiac catheterization at that time and
was felt to be not competent to do such. Then his mental status
improved and he was deemed competent. He continued to refuse
cardiac catheterization. In 10 of September he was transferred from
Tibay Thesardslost A The Medical Center to Ngreen Medical Center County after difficulty
breathing and coughing up green-brown sputum for a couple of days.
He had chest pressure radiating to his left arm and his jaw and
this lasted for hours. He ruled out at Ngreen Medical Center County for
myocardial infarction. He had 0.5 mm ST depressions in V4 through
V6. He was treated there for unstable angina with nitropaste ,
aspirin , heparin and transferred to Pagham University Of on
aminophylline and heparin IV drips.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Vital signs - 98.1 temperature ,
84 heart rate , 146/82 blood pressure , room
air sat was 98%. He was slightly labored breathing on admission ,
but was not in respiratory distress. His jugular venous pulsations
were visible approximately 3 cm above the angle. He had decreased
breath sounds bilaterally and moderate , diffuse wheezing
throughout. Heart - Sounds were very distant across the precordium
although audible at the epigastrium , S1 and S2 were normal. There
was no murmurs , gallops or rubs. He did not have any rashes. His
mental status was intact although he had increased rate of speech
and rapid thoughts.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission - 141 sodium , 4.1 potassium , 100
chloride , 27 bicarb , 118 glucose , 26/1.2 ,
BUN/creatinine. WBC 10.39 , hematocrit 44.1 , platelet count 190.
CK was 100. troponin 0.7 , calcium was 9.5 , magnesium 2.2 , valproic
acid 42 level.
EKG on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per
minute. He had a normal axis. His R-wave progression was normal.
Intervals are 0.128 , 0.96 , 0.394. He had inverted Ts in 1 and L
and nonspecific T-wave changes throughout with some 0.5 mm ST
depressions at baseline in his inferior leads.
Chest x-ray was normal.
He was admitted and declined catheterization initially , asking about an
exercise test first. He had his sputum gram stain
which showed gram positive cocci and gram positive rods. He was started on IV
cefuroxime. His heparin and aminophylline were discontinued on
admission. He was treated mainly for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare. He had a history of steroid induced psychosis. He
was treated with inhaled steroids and Albuterol and Azmacort via
nebulization. He improved his peak flows on admission which were
approximately 250; discharge peak flows were between 500 and 700.
He underwent an exercise echocardiogram on 11 of August which showed one
mm ST depression on top of the half mm baseline ST depressions of
the inferior leads , potentially consistent with ischemia although
when the echo images were reviewed they were not thought to be
consistent with ischemia. There was no change in wall motion
during exercise as compared to rest.
