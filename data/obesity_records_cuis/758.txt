PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN AND PRESYNCOPE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: ( 1 ) HYPERTENSION.
( 2 ) ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL.
( 3 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST
CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERY ON

( 4 ) STATUS POST BLADDER SUSPENSION SURGERY.
( 5 ) PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease who was admitted on 2/9/97 for bladder suspension surgery
to Akcare Hospital The plan at that time was for a laparoscopic
procedure , but because of bladder puncture , it was converted to an
open procedure. She had ST depressions on EKG intraoperatively ,
and was admitted to the ICU there. She was treated for a
myocardial infarction and developed postmyocardial angina with EKG
changes which were unrelieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. For
this reason , she was started on IV TNG and transferred to I Warho Hospital for cardiac catheterization. She underwent cardiac
catheterization on 1/10/97 and this revealed three vessel disease.
She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 3/4/97 with a
LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA , and SVG to OM1. Her postoperative course
was complicated by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , with which she
was symptomatic. She was started on procainamide during the
admission and was discharged home on 1/4/97 with a subtherapeutic
proc/nepa level ( 3.0-4.5 ). She arrived home at 4:30 p.m. and felt
well until approximately 7:00 p.m. , when she developed acute onset
of 8 out of 10 chest pain across her entire chest radiating down
the left arm and associated with light-headedness and visual
changes. She reported this was similar to a prior anginal episode.
She took three sublingual nitroglycerin at home and had no relief.
EMTs were called and found the patient pale , diaphoretic , with
blood pressure 90/palp , and a heart rate of 150. She was treated
with more nitroglycerin and improved somewhat in terms of her pain.
She was taken to Akcare Hospital where EKG showed rapid atrial
fibrillation with ST depressions globally. She was given IV fluids
and 750 mg of procainamide , as well as 20 mg of IV Cardizem and
nitroglycerin. Her pain resolved. Her systolic blood pressure
came up to the 110 range and her atrial fibrillation rate decreased
to the 80s. Subsequently , she converted into normal sinus rhythm
with a rate in the 60s and was transferred to the I Warho Hospital for further treatment. Her pain lasted for approximately
one hour in total. On arrival to the I Warho Hospital on
the floor , she had 3 out of 10 chest pain , without shortness of
breath , presyncope or palpitations. This pain radiates to the back
and was reproducible with left-sided sternal pressure unlike her
prior anginal episodes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Hypertension; ( 2 ) High cholesterol;
( 3 ) Coronary artery disease status post CABG
on 3/4/97 with anatomy as described above; ( 4 ) Bladder suspension
surgery in 1995 and 1997; ( 5 ) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
perioperatively.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Atenolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; ( 2 ) Percocet 1-2
tabs p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.; ( 3 ) Coumadin; ( 4 ) Axid 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d.; ( 5 ) cephradine 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. x7 days for wound
infection in the vein harvest site; ( 6 ) procainamide 750 mg p.o.
q.i.d. ( she was receiving 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. in hospital prior to
discharge ).
FAMILY HISTORY: History of a son with a myocardial infarction at
age 39 , brother with an MI at age 64 , and a mother
with an MI at age 64.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband at home and does not
smoke tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS - Heart rate 59 , BP 100/60 ,
respiratory rate 20 , sat 98 on three liters
with temp 97.7. GENERAL - She was an elderly woman in no acute
distress. HEENT - Oropharynx is benign. NECK - She has normal
jugular venous pressure at approximately 8 cm. CHEST - Clear to
auscultation and percussion. HEART - Remarkable for S1 and S2.
Regular rhythm , no murmurs. She had a surgical scar in the midline
which is healing without any pus or signs of inflammation. ABDOMEN
- Benign. She had a midline scar which was healing without
erythema or pus. EXTREMITIES - Revealed a left lower extremity
medial scar with erythema but no pus. She had left-sided edema , 2+
to the mid shin , but there was no edema on the right side. She had
1-2+ decreased pulses bilaterally. Her feet were cool but her
neurologic function was intact. She had normal capillary refill.
NEURO - Non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , with normal electrolytes.
She had a white count 15 and hematocrit 40. Her
LFTs were within normal limits , and her CK was 55. EKG , at the
time of admission here , showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 59 ,
with intervals of 0.2 , 0.08 , and 484. She had a left axis of -34
degrees and evidence of an old inferior MI. She had T-wave
inversions in lead I , L , V2-V6 , and II , and she had ST elevations
( slight ) in leads III and F ). These were unchanged during her
episode of chest pain upon arrival compared with her EKG from the
morning of discharge.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In short , this was a 72-year-old woman who was
status post coronary artery bypass grafting 12
days prior to admission , who was now readmitted within four hours
of discharge because of rapid atrial fibrillation and chest pain
lasting for an hour.
She was admitted and found to be in normal sinus rhythm at the time
of admission. Her procainamide was increased to 750 mg p.o. q.i.d.
given that her levels of proc/nepa were subtherapeutic at the time
of discharge earlier in the day. Given her history of one hour of
chest pain , she was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial
CKs which were flat. However , her troponin came back at 5.1 the
following morning. It rapidly trended downward , and so it was
unclear as to whether she had actually suffered any myocardial
damage. Other possible explanations for her chest pain included:
Question of pericarditic , post-pericardiotomy pain vs. coronary
disease vs non-cardiac causes. In addition , at the time of
admission , she had an Infectious Disease issue and her white blood
cell count was elevated at the outside hospital , and there was some
erythema around her left leg site.
On hospital day #2 , she had an episode of atrial fibrillation at a
rate of 140-150 with symptoms of palpitation but no chest pain.
Her proc and nepa levels were therapeutic at this time ( 6.0-9.0 ).
On the following day , she had an episode of atypical chest pain
without EKG changes and which was different from her prior angina.
The following evening , she had an additional episode of chest pain.
At this time , she had a heart rate of approximately 160 and was
found to be in atrial fibrillation with no ST-T wave changes. This
episode resolved with 2.5 mg of IV Lopressor within 10 minutes.
On 11/17/97 , she underwent an echocardiogram which showed a normal
LV size , with mild concentric hypertrophy. There was normal
systolic function and an ejection fraction of 66% , with inferior
hypokinesis. Based on this information , it was decided that the
patient probably did not have an MI. At this time , the decision
was made that she had failed procainamide , as she had now broke
through several times with atrial fibrillation , well therapeutic on
the procainamide. The procainamide was discontinued and she was
loaded on amiodarone at a dosage of 600 mg p.o. t.i.d. x13 doses.
On 10/10/97 , she underwent an ETT MIBI which showed mild
peri-infarct ischemia but no ST-T wave changes and the patient had
no symptoms at nine minutes on a submax Bruce.
At the time of discharge , she remained on amiodarone at a dose of
200 mg p.o. q.d. and she has been restarted on her Coumadin for
which she will be followed by the Anticoagulation Service. At the
time of discharge , she has been in normal sinus rhythm for over 36
hours. Her other issues during this hospitalization having
included infectious disease for which she was on cephradine because
of some wound site erythema and an elevated white blood cell count
at an outside hospital. She was treated with five days of
cephradine and remained afebrile. In addition , she was started on
levofloxacin for concern about a UTI , given her complaints of
urinary frequency. However , it is more likely that this urinary
frequency is related to her underlying urologic problems. In terms
of her anticoagulation , she was maintained on a IV heparin while
not on Coumadin. She is restarting with careful recoumadinization
given the fact that she is now on amiodarone.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) amiodarone
200 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 3 ) atenolol 100 mg p.o.
q.d.; ( 4 ) Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 5 ) sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n.; ( 6 ) Coumadin as directed; ( 7 ) Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
( 8 ) Ativan 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. anxiety; ( 9 ) Premarin
0.625 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 10 ) Pravachol 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. She has now
been in sinus rhythm for over 36 hours. It seems likely that she
will not require long-term amiodarone or Coumadin.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with her
cardiologist , Dr. Jackson Part , so that the
decision can be made as to when she may stop taking her amiodarone
and Coumadin.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home on
4/2/97.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
