IMPRESSION: 58yo M s/p cardiac transplant c/b allograft vasculopathy ,
recent admission in 10/6 for pulmonary hemorrhage/PNA admitted with
increased SOB and hemoptysis. Likely CHF exacerbation +/- ILD +/- PNA
( CAP , atypicals , TB , PCP , fungal ). Patient's shortness of breath responded
to diuresis , and his symptoms improved. However bronchoscopy revealed
RML fresh blood , and CT chest is concerning for RML mass. Will need
follow up with pulmonary which is already arranged.
1. ) CV: No evidence of ischemia. Patient continued outpatient ASA ,
bblocker , statin , plavix. H/o cardiac transplant. Cyclosporine level on
10/27 was 152. His cyclosporine was increased during admission to 100mg po
BID. His sirolimus was discontinued.
PUMP- He was intially volume overloaded on exam. BNP on admission was 674.
He was diuresed with lasix 40mg po BID , and will be discharged on lasix
40mg po daily. Also given potassium 10meq a day , will need lytes
followed. His HCTZ was discontinued. Weight on day of discharge was
62.2kg. BP control with home regimen of dilt , lopressor , cadura.
2. ) PULM: Pulmonary was consulted. CT was negative for PE. He had a
bronchoscopy which was described above ( fresh blood oozing from RML ). BAL
was sent for multiple studies. PCP was negative , influenza negative , adeno
negative , viral studies , cultures , and cytology are pending at this time.
Galact Ag was negative. GBM antibody was negative. ANCA is pending.
Bronchoscopy and chest CT were concerning for RML mass. He will follow up
with a PET CT and Pulmonary appointment on 9/2/07. Allergy was consulted
re whether his symptoms could be an allergic pneumonitis ( given history of
ASA allergy , an previous desensitization , and they felt it was unlikely.
Rheumatology was consulted re possible vasculitis given new proteinuria -
thought unlikely although final consult recommendations were pending at
time of discharge. He will be discharged on oxygen given desat to 87% on
RA with ambulation. He will be treated empirically with levofloxacin x 14
day course to finish on 6/2/07 in case mass seen in RML is infectious.1
3. ) HEME: LENIs negative. has iron defiency anemia which will need to be
continued to follow.
4. ) ENDO: NIDDM , diet controlled.
6. ) renal: proteinuria , no explanation , will need further follow up.
