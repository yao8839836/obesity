**********************
Hospital Course by Problem:
88 yo with recent STEMI , managed medically , here with CHF
exacerbation in setting non med adherence and zoster. Patient is non
adherent to meds given recent increase in number of total meds since STEMIi.
olypharmacy seems to have overwhelmed the patient , so efforts were made to
reduced his med list to just "essential meds" to improve adherence. Patient
remains on TID and BID dosed HTNive meds which is not ideal , but we will
defer adjustment of his cardiac regimen to his cardiologist. For now , iron ,
nexium , probenecid , ergocalcitriol , nephrocaps have been taken off the emd
list , but can be added back in if seen fit.
1 ) CV:
ISCHEMIA: Recent STEMI , not stented given potential contrast load
in setting of CRI ( no HD ). On this admission , no chest pain , some TWI in
chest leads , but cardiac enzymes negative. Continue home doses ASA , Zocor.
PUMP: CHF exacerbation: Received 60mg Lasix IV x1 ,
diuresed well with resolution of pulm edema , dyspnea. Will discharge on
home regimen Lasix 40mg PO BID QDay for next three days , then back to prior
dose of 80 mg po qd alternating with 40 mg po qd.
Satting 95% on RA at discharge.
Had brief episode of bradycardia to 40 , but no symptoms or EKG changes.
Will keep on high Labetalol dose given severe CAD without stent , only
medical management. Continue amlodipine , Hydralazine for HTN
RHYTHM: no active issues besides asymptomatic bradycardia.
3 ) Zoster ( shingles ): Began Valacyclovir , will dischage with 6 more days
of this med. Calamine for pruritis offered some relief.
4 ) Anemia: secondary to renal failure. cont weekly epo injections and iron
supplements
5 ) DM: diet controlled.
6 ) Med noncompliance: arranged for VNA to help with med scheduling.
7 ) CRI: high BUN/CR , but same as previous admission. Metabolic
acidosis from inability to excrete H+. Refused HD. Continue Phoslo ,
Kaexylate.
8 ) ANEMIA: most likely secondary to renal failure. Will continue weekly
epo shots as needed
9 ) RHEUM: hold probenecid for gout given CRI
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take all meds daily
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
