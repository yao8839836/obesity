BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
I. INFORMATION
**Presentation:
73 yo F with PMH of AS AVA 0.74 cm2 , median gradient 36
mmHg , multiple CHF exacs in past , DM , HTN , clinically in
CHF exacerbation.
PMH: worsening AS AVA 074 cm2 , LVEF 65% , mild TR ,
hypothyroidism , DM on insulin , CKD
Final Diagnosis: CHF exacerbation
Treatment and Response:
Note that it was very difficult to monitor her fluid status -JVP
difficult 2/2 girth of neck , often incontinent so I/O inaccurate , and has
chronic leg edema 2/2 PVD. Therefore , we adjusted diuretic regimen
primarily by how she symptomatically felt and her weights.
Initially treated with Torsemide 200 iv bid , Zaroxylyn 5 mg po bid
( 30 min before torsemide ) , and Aldactone 25 po bid. She diuresed well to
this. Over the course of hospital stay , her creatinine increased
from 1.6 to 2.2 , and though her baseline is 1.6-2.0 , we used this , along
with her symptomatic improvement and return of weight to dry weight of
114.5 kg , to establish euvolemia. For final 3 days of stay on
home regimen of torsemide 150 po bid , zaroxlyn 5 po qd , and
aldactone 25 po bid and had stable weights.
Relevant Data: Weight at d/c 114.5; VS @ d/c 98.0 , 81 , 106/60 , 20 ,
93 on RA; rales at left base
Brief Hospital Course:
See above for CHF related info
In addition , pt was found to have pan-sensitive E-coli UTI - treated with
Bactrim x 7 days. Two days before discharge her initial cough worsened
in severity and became somewhat productive. She never mounted a WBC ,
never was febrile , and CXR showed no infiltrate. Felt to be 2/2
underlying COPD - improved significantly with nebulizer tx and
Robitussen. During hospital stay , she was evaluated for home 02;
however , her ambulatory 02 sat was 94% and her nocturnal O2 sats ( done by
respiratory therapy ) were 89-93%. Therefore , not discharged on home 02 ,
though may want to consider as outpt.
II Action Plan:
