***************************************
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
Her nexium dose was increased and she was initiated on reglan. Although
she initially agreed to an ETT-MIBI ( refused dobutamine , avoiding
adenosine/persantine due to COPD/asthma ) , on the day of the procedure
she refused saying "there is nothing wrong with my heart". A similar
refusal occurred on a past admission. She is to be discharged w/ f/u
with Dr. Kaupp
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have any more chest pain please take a nitroglycerin. If the
pain does not go away call an ambulance. You may have heart disease
causing chest pain and so you will benefit from a stress test. Please
discuss with your doctor about scheduling this. Continue to take your
home medications. We have changed the dosing on the nexium and we have
added Reglan to help move food along.
