HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 49 year old lady was admitted
with increasing shortness of breath
and increasing abdominal girth in a setting of known dilated
cardiomyopathy on the cardiac transplant list.
Her history extends back to 1995 when she was fist admitted with
shortness of breath and an ejection fraction of 15% with 3+ mitral
regurgitation in a setting of excessive alcohol use. Her
cardioangiogram at that time showed right dominant system without
coronary artery disease and her exercise stress test revealed a VO2
of 12.6. The presumptive diagnosis at that time was alcoholic
relation dilatation cardiomyopathy. In 11/18 she represented with
an ejection fraction of 20% with moderate mitral regurgitation and
left atrial enlargement and she was treated with digoxin , diuretics
and ace inhibitors. It subsequently was revealed that there was a
strong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and , in fact ,
subsequently two of her sons , ages 13 years old , were diagnosed
with dilated cardiomyopathy and her diagnosis was therefore altered
from alcoholic to familial cardiomyopathy. In 10/22 she was
admitted with acute pancreatitis and developed acute renal failure
requiring intubation. Her stay was complicated by Staphylococcal
bacteremia. She recovered but presented again in 11/13 with a
history of progressive shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion ,
orthopnea , PND and abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting and
anorexia. She required dobutamine and IV Lasix and had an episode
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. In 11/10 she presented
with syncope in the presence of a potassium of 2.4 and was
diagnosed with Torsades de Pointes in the setting of hypokalemia
and acute TC of 0.68. In 3/14 she represented with an ejection
fraction of 20% with a left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis and
required IV diuresis. In 3/26 she had a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy for multiple gallstones. In 1/20 she was admitted
for cardiac transplant evaluation and found to a VO2 of 9.2 , a DLCL
of 62% predicted and she was negative for PPD. She was admitted in
9/18 for IV diuresis and potassium repletion , and again in 5/12
with abdominal distention and orthopnea. Pancreatitis was ruled
out at that stage and she was again treated with IV Lasix. She
represented on her last admission on 23 of September with congestive heart
failure requiring intravenous Lasix , Aldactone , Diuril and
Zaroxolyn , ultimately requiring dobutamine for inotropic support
for a short period of time.
On this admission she gives a history of two days of increased
shortness of breath with orthopnea and mild PND with diminished
exercise tolerance. She has been reluctant to combine torsemide
and her regular intravenous Lasix at home which was given to her by
the VNA and feeling increasingly shortness of breath she was taken
to the emergency department at Stusri Medical Center There she was
treated with 200 mg of IV Lasix and had a 1.2 liter diuresis , felt
better , and was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation
and management.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married with four children and she is
an ex-smoker for the last year , previously 10
cigarettes a day for life and previously a heavy drinker up to 1-2
liters of spirits per day.
FAMILY HISTORY: As above shows strong family history of dilated
cardiomyopathy , with her mother dying at the age
of 36 from a sudden cardiac death , her grandmother dying at the age
of 52 from what appears to have been cardiomyopathy , and two of her
brothers dying at the age of 32 and 42 with heart related problems.
Two of her sons as I mentioned were diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy , one of whom remains quite unwell.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg once a day; Diuril
500 mg once a day; digoxin 0.625 mg once
a day; Colace 100 mg twice a day; Aldactone 25 mg once a day;
Torsemide 100 mg in the morning , 15 mg in the p.m.; K-Dur 100 q.
a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Alert and oriented , in no
distress. She was comfortable. Evidence of
labored breathing. Her pulse was tachycardic at 103 with
respiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 84/58. Her
temperature was 98.2. She had diminished radial pulses
bilaterally. She had borderline proptosis with a jugular venous
distention at the angle of the jaw. She had no bruits and no
thyromegaly. She had a loud S3 and S4 with a dynamic precordium
and a displaced PMI with a quiet MR. She had a palpable S4. Her
respiratory examination showed her lungs were markedly clear to
percussion and auscultation without wheeze. Abdomen was mildly
distended without evidence of shifting dullness. Bowel sounds were
normal. She had an inverted umbilicus. She had no peripheral
edema and good peripheral pulses.
Chest x-ray showed a large globular heart without fluid in the
bases with mild upper lobe venous diversion. Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm with a left axis and ventricular
conduction defect and left ventricular hypertrophy high voltage.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 3.6 , white count 6.6 ,
hematocrit 37.9. Cardiac enzymes were normal. I
note her right catheterization results of 4/22/99 showed a mean
right atrial pressure of 12 , right ventricular pressure of 38/14 , a
mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 21 with a cardiac index
of 2.88 , and a cardiac output of 4.93 and an SVO of 1022.
IMPRESSION: This was a 49 year old lady with dilated
cardiomyopathy , probably familial in nature , with
increased abdominal girth and shortness of breath , on the
transplant list , admitted for diuresis , plus or minus optimization
therapy.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was initially treated with b.i.d. Lasix 200
mg IV and had an excellent diuresis on this
regimen. We increased her Aldactone to 50 mg once a day to try and
obtain better potassium control and eventually we added metolazone
at 2.5 mg in the morning. During her admission she had a very
significant improvement with negative diuresis of almost 2 liters
every day for the past 3 days. She had a cortisol stimulation
tests which revealed normal synthetic adrenal function and she had
a normal TSH. She required extensive potassium repletion during
her stay and she is discharged on 120 total of K-Dur per day.
During her hospital stay her glucoses were over 250 for a short
period of time and it was felt that it was probably appropriate to
start her on oral hypoglycemics. However in the setting of
changing her diuretic medications and a hospital diet , this was
considered this could be delayed until her next outpatient visit
with Dr. Gasaway
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d.; amiodarone 200 mg
q.d.; digoxin 0.0625 mg q.d.; M.V.I.
therapeutic 1 tablet q.d.; K-Dur 14 mEq t.i.d.; Aldactone 50 mg
q.d.; Torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.; Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg q. o.d.; Coumadin 5
mg q. h.s.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: To home with VNA for Coumadin , potassium checks and
intravenous 200 mg of Lasix p.r.n.
FOLLOWUP: She will follow up with Dr. Board next Wednesday and
she will have her potassium checked tomorrow in the VH
laboratory , result of which will be forwarded to Dr. Board and any
necessary change to her K-Dur therapy will be managed therefrom.
