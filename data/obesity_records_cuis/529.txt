PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease; ( 2 ) COPD;
( 3 ) diabetes mellitus; ( 4 ) infrarenal AAA
documented at 4.5 cm in 6/27 ( 5 ) gout; ( 6 ) history of DVT;
( 7 ) arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; simvastatin 20 mg p.o.
q.h.s.; glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o.
q.d.; K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d.; albuterol and Atrovent; Pulmicort 4
puffs b.i.d.; MVI 1 tab p.o. q.d.; allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.;
Neurontin t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Theophylline , which gives her anaphylaxis , and to both
sulfa and dye , which are of unclear significance.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. She quit smoking one week prior
to admission. She smoked one pack per day for 50
years. She rarely uses alcohol. She has three grown children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother with a history of MI at age 75. Father
with a history of lung cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Elderly female in no apparent
distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temp 99 , pulse 100 ,
BP 130/60 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 96% on two liters. HEENT:
PERRL , EOMI , oropharynx benign , no erythema or exudate. No sinus
tenderness. NECK: Supple , no JVD , no bruits , no lymphadenopathy.
CHEST: Revealed rales at the right base , otherwise no wheezes at
the left. HEART: Regular rhythm and rate , normal S1 , S2 , II/VI
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
positive bowel sounds , soft , diffusely tender , no
hepatosplenomegaly , no masses. EXTREMITIES: Bilateral non-pitting
edema , left greater than right , with mild lower extremity erythema ,
also left greater than right. NEURO: Alert and oriented x3 ,
cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Her left
index and middle finger PIP joints were warm and tender.
LABORATORY DATA: White count 13.4 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 211.
Na 136 , K 4.3 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.1. CK 47 ,
troponin 0.14. EKG showed normal sinus tach at 125 beats/minute.
She had a new incomplete right bundle branch block , left atrial
enlargement , no acute ST or T-wave changes. Chest x-ray revealed
question of a right lower lobe infiltrate. This was also
consistent with a mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Daughtrey , in the Emergency Department , was
treated with IV cefuroxime. She was subsequently
brought to the floor , and the Medical Team's assessment decided to
treat her empirically for a right lower lobe pneumonia with
levofloxacin. It was not all that clear that Ms. Daughtrey had a
pneumonia , but she was treated for this anyway. She also had a
urine Legionella antigen , which was checked , as well as sputum
cultures which were unremarkable.
From a cardiovascular perspective , Ms. Daughtrey ruled out for a
myocardial infarction , but received some Lasix for mild CHF.
During her hospital course , it was noted that her hematocrit
dropped from 33.3 to 28.4. This was mildly concerning given her
history of an infrarenal AAA. It was decided that she should have
an abdominal CT. This was done , and the abdominal aortic aneurysm
has not changed in size or did not reveal any evidence of leaking.
Ms. Daughtrey quickly improved after being treated with nebulizers.
She was then switched from nebulizers to inhalers and it was
decided that she was well enough to go home. Of note , her right
finger joints were mildly swollen and possibly consistent with a
gouty flare. She was treated initially with Indocin , but then
there was the concern that she could potentially have a GI bleed.
Thus , she was quickly taken off of the Indocin.
Ms. Daughtrey was discharged in stable condition to follow-up with her
primary care physician. Her discharge medications were as follows:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) albuterol
inhalers; ( 3 ) allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.;

week. She is to have a follow-up chest x-ray in several weeks to
reassess the right lower lobe.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
