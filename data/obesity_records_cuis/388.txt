Discharge Date: 7/3/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: NEPHROTIC SYNDROME , PEDAL EDEMA.
PROBLEM LIST: 1. DIABETES MELLITUS.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. BIPOLAR DISORDER.
4. PANIC DISORDER.
5. RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
6. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.
7. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old man with
a medical history as listed above who
presented with 3 weeks of worsening bilateral leg edema. The edema
started approximately 6 months ago and has worsened over the past 3
weeks. He has gained approximately 20 pounds since the summer. In
August he was seen by his primary care physician and found to be
fluid overloaded and started on Lasix. Unfortunately he has not
responded to even 180 mg p.o. Lasix q day. Concomitant with the
edema he has increased dyspnea on exertion for about 1 1/2 weeks.
His ability to exercise is limited by his dyspnea and he can only
climb one set of stairs compared to 2 sets about 6 months ago. He
does not have symptoms of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea. In April of 2002 his pulmonary function studies revealed
obstructive dysfunction and he was started on Combivent inhalers
with good response. He has had 2 episodes of chest pain in September of
2002 for which he was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction ,
at that time MIBI was negative. He denies any palpitations on this
admission. His last echocardiogram on September , 2002 showed an
ejection fraction of approximately 65-70% with mild concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy and trace mitral regurgitation. The
patient is homeless , unemployed and left the Ee
several days prior to admission. He has lived with his friends
since then.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Blood pressure 180 systolic , jugular
venous pressure at approximately 8 cm.
He has a normal pulmonary exam as well as a normal cardiac exam.
He has evidence of bilateral pitting edema to his hip.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a urine showing 13 grams
of protein per day.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old gentleman with diastolic
dysfunction , congestive heart failure ,
nephrotic syndrome who has failed oral diuretics. In the hospital
he had evidence of nephrotic-range proteinuria. He had a negative BNP
suggesting the nephrotic syndrome to be the major cause of his shortness
of breath more than congestive heart failure. Venous insufficiency and
standing on his feet most days were also likely contributors to his pedal
edema. Of
note , this nephrotic syndrome is likely due to long standing diabetes induced
nephropathy.
1. Cardiology: The plan is to continue enteric coated aspirin 325
mg p.o. q day and continue with his Ace inhibitor. The patient was
diuresed aggressively in the hospital and by the time of discharge
he had been switched from Diltiazem and metoprolol over to labetalol 1200
mg b.i.d. He will need Torsemide for diuresis , currently 100 mg qd. The plan
will be for him to get daily weights and he will be followed by a
congestive heart failure nurse. His weight upon discharge is 129
kilograms.
2. Respiratory: The patient has no dyspnea or respiratory
distress on discharge. The plan is to continue with his outpatient
inhalers.
3. Diabetes: The patient has good control on Lantus insulin and
will continue that.
4. Peripheral: The patient was fitted for Jobst stockings which
he should wear to his knee and should be used daily. His edema was greatly
improved with stockings and adequate diuresis.
5. Hematology: The patient has relatively new onset normocytic or
macrocytic anemia which will require an outpatient work up.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day ,
Atrovent inhaler 1-2 puffs inhaled
q.i.d. , labetalol 1200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lisinopril 30 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , torsemide 100 mg p.o. q day , Flovent 110 mcg inhaled
b.i.d. , Lamictal 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lantus 46 units subcutaneously
q.h.s. , Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q day , potassium chloride slow
release 10 mEq p.o. q day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: To the Try Ln.
He will need close follow-up of his pulse , blood pressure , weight ,
electrolytes , blood sugars , and medical compliance.
