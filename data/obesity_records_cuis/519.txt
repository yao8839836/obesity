Discharge Date:
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: SYNCOPE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST
STENTING , AND BRADYCARDIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old woman with
coronary risk factors of diabetes
mellitus , insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension , age , and
elevated cholesterol , who was admitted to the Cardiology Service
after a syncope in vascular clinic. Patient was in her usual state
of health while in vascular clinic , awaiting to discuss the results
of arterial studies with her vascular surgeon , when she noted to
slump over in the chair in the waiting room for about 1-2 minutes.
She was unresponsive at the time. A code blue was called. By the
time the code team arrived to the scene , the patient was awake and
alert , with a regular pulse. Her blood pressure was noted to be in
the 140s. The patient did not recall an aura or a prodrome. She
denied any incontinence and aura or postictal confusion. She was
taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation , where she was
afebrile , with a heart rate of 96.1 , heart rate of 100 , a pressure
of 178/82 , with oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She was
then transferred to the floor for further evaluation and
management.
Her past medical history is as follows: 1. Coronary artery
disease , status post multiple catheterizations in the past. Her
most recent catheterization was in October of 2000 , which showed a
proximal RCA stenosis of 100% and a distal LAD lesion of 40-50%.
She was also noted to have luminal irregularities at the OM-1 at a
site of previous stenting. 2. Peripheral vascular disease ,
history of chronic ulcers , status post a left femoral to anterior
tibial bypass graft; also , status post a patch angioplasty in the
left groin. 3. Diabetes mellitus. Hemoglobin A1C of 9% in October
of 2002. 4. Hypertension. 5. Blindness , legally blind in both
eyes.
Medications on admission included enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q. day , captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.
day , Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , NPH 15
U q.a.m. regular 5 U q.a.m. , Hytrin 5 mg p.o. q. day , Procardia XL
60 mg p.o. q. day , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. day , Niferex 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , and Naprosyn 325 mg p.o. q. day. The patient has no known
drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in Nordecho Monte near her daughter. She
spends most of her time at home. She does not
smoke and does not drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: She was afebrile. Heart rate was 50
and regular. Blood pressure was
140/80. Respiratory rate was 20 , saturation of 98% on room air.
She was a pleasant African American woman lying in bed. She has
her right eye closed. She had a surgical right pupil , with a left
cataract. Her oropharynx was benign , her mucous membranes were
moist. She had no jugular venous distention. There was a question
of soft bilateral carotid bruits. The lungs revealed decreased
breath sound at the left apex , but otherwise was clear to
auscultation. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and
rhythm , there were no murmurs appreciated in the Emergency
Department. The abdomen was soft , without hepatosplenomegaly. In
the extremities , there are incisional scars at the medial calves on
both legs , with 1+ DP pulses bilaterally , her legs were warm , and
there was no edema. On neuro exam , she was alert and oriented x 3 ,
cranial nerves III-XII were grossly normal , and her motor exam was
without focal deficits.
LABORATORIES OF NOTE: Her potassium was 3.8 , her BUN was 39 , and
her creatinine was 1.9 , her baseline
creatinine being anywhere between 1.7 and 2.0. Glucose was 122.
Her troponin on admission was 0.32 , and of note , back in October
she had also been admitted and was noted to have a troponin in the
.3 range. Her CK on this admission was 308 , with an MB fraction of
3.9. Calcium was 9.2 , magnesium was 2.7 , white blood cell count
6.1 , hematocrit 36 , platelets 238. Her UA was negative. Her EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 85 , with left axis deviation ,
evidence of LVH , left atrial enlargement , and some T wave
flattening in V4 through 6 and T wave inversion in 1 and L. Her
chest x-ray was without infiltrate or pulmonary arterial
congestion.
In summary , this is a 65-year-old woman with vasculopathy and
extensive coronary artery disease , who presented with sudden
syncope x 1-2 minutes. Given the history , the story was very
concerning for a malignant arrhythmia. She was admitted for
further workup of ischemic or malignant arrhythmia causes of her
syncope.
Her hospital course is summarized by systems: 1. CARDIOVASCULAR:
The patient was placed on the monitor and no definitye symptomatic arrhythmias
were observed. However , because of her demonstrated asymetrically
hypertrophied left ventricle and ergions of inferoposterior scar ,
electrophysiology study was recommended ( see below and addendum ).
The patient was initially admitted with a troponin of
0.32 , which on repeat examination was 0.87. It was
thought to be consistent with a very small non-Q-wave MI. She was
started on heparin for 48 hours. On 10/30/2002 , the patient had an
adenosine MIBI , which showed a moderate size lesion of
inferolateral and a small apical region of reversible ischemic.
She had a cardiac catheterization on 1/9/2002 , which revealed an
80% proximal circumflex lesion which was stented to 0%. She had an
echocardiogram performed on 3/10/2002 , which showed a left atrium of 2.9 cm.
She had asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy , with preserved overall
systolic function and an ejection fraction estimated to be 60%. This was
thought to be a potential source of focus for ventricular arrhythmias , and
further supported the decision to go to electrophysiology study.
2. PULMONARY: One of the considerations entertained to explain
the patient's syncope was a potential pulmonary embolus. Though
she had not been hypoxic on presentation , the sudden nature of the
event , as well as her tachycardia , was felt to warrant further
workup for a PE. She had a D-dimer sent , which came back at &gt;1000.
She later had a VQ scan which was read as low probability. Lower
extremity noninvasive ultrasounds of both legs revealed no
thrombus.
3. ENDOCRINE: The patient has insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus. We continued her morning NPH dose and covered her with
regular insulin sliding scale for the remainder of her
hospitalization. Her sugars were relatively well controlled
throughout.
4. SOCIAL/PSYCH: The patient has a known difficult home
situation , with previous known problems with her son and other
family members. Social Services was involved. They interviewed
the patient and involved a consult to Chedent Medical Center .  At the
time of this dictation , that evaluation is still pending.
The final disposition of the patient is still pending at this time.
I will complete this dictation at the time of discharge , including
the patient's disposition and disposition medications.
