833886231 | PUO | 11020818 | | 302346 | 4/1/2000 12:00:00 AM | CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 10/29/2000 Report Status: Signed

Discharge Date: 7/9/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old woman
with coronary artery disease and
cardiomyopathy admitted with clinical shortness of breath. The
patient has a long history of coronary artery disease with most
recent echocardiogram in 8/06 showing dilated left ventricle ,
ejection fraction of 30% to 35% , inferior posterior thinning and
akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the distal septum to apex.
There was remaining wall of hypokinesis. There was also trace
aortic insufficiency and hypertrophied right ventricle. The most
recent catheterization was 11/4/99 showing a left main with 30%
distal stenosis , occluded left anterior descending , right coronary
artery with 40% proximal and mid 70% stenoses. The grafts were
without significant disease. The left heart catheterization showed
left ventricle pressures of 220/80. Left ventriculography revealed
an ejection fraction of 50% to 55% with trace mitral regurgitation.
( Please refer to past medical history for further details of the
patient's cardiac history ). The patient now reports malaise for
one week with increasing dyspnea on exertion. She also reports
fever to 101 two days ago with cough productive of white sputum.
She reports that she went to Urgent Care and received Bactrim. She
also had received Bactrim 48 hours ago. She also complains of
increased orthopnea , baseline two-pillow orthopnea and now
five-pillow orthopnea and nighttime cough. She denies dietary
indiscretion or medical noncompliance and reports that her
peripheral edema is stable. She denies dysuria or frequency and
also believes that her weight has increased although notes on chart
indicate that her baseline is 220 to 228 pounds.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiac risk
factors were age and hypertension. Diabetes
mellitus , nonproliferative anemia , one non-Q wave myocardial
infarction in 1981 , coronary artery bypass grafting in 1995 at
Pagham University Of with left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending graft , saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery graft , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
graft. Several admissions for congestive heart failure including
one in 1996 which included an echocardiogram with ejection fraction
of 40%. Decreased from earlier 59% with inferior posterior
hypokinesis. Congestive heart failure admission in 2/11 with an
echocardiogram that showed ejection fraction of 30% to 35% ,
decreased from previous echocardiogram. Non-Q wave myocardial
infarction in 8/06 at Pagham University Of with troponin of
6. Baseline left bundle branch block. Insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus. Status post right carotid endarterectomy.
Hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , status post appendectomy ,
status post right mastoidectomy ( secondary to recurrent otitis ).
History of recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Amaurosis fugax
in left eye. The patient was treated with Coumadin after 2/14
admission. Head CT showed no sign of infarct. Echocardiogram was
negative for PFO. Ejection fraction at the time was 60%.
Loculated pleural effusion in 4/9 with apparent decortication and
lysis. Nephrolithiasis but none times greater than two years.
Bell's palsy resolved.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes hives. Ceclor causes a rash.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , EC-ASA 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Cozaar 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zestril 20
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Hytrin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 50 q.a.m. , 8 q.p.m. subcutaneously ,
Slow-K eight once a day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Retired housewife , married , rare alcohol use , no
tobacco use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother with myocardial infarction at
age 40 and a father with myocardial infarction at
age 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.1 , pulse 59 ,
blood pressure 180/82 , respirations 22 , and
96% on room air. Weight 226 pounds. General: Large woman lying
in bed in no acute distress. HEENT: Jugulovenous pressure greater
than 12 cm , oropharynx clear , no thyromegaly. Chest: Bibasilar
crackles and diffuse wheezes and rhonchi , no E to A changes.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. There was a II/VI
systolic murmur loudest at bases , question S4 , S1 and S2. Abdomen:
Soft , protuberant , nontender , benign. Extremities: Bilateral
edema to knees , minimally pitting. Neurologic: Cranial nerves and
strength intact.
LABORATORY/X-RAY STUDIES: Notable for BUN of 55 ( baseline high 20s
in 8/06 ) , creatinine of 1.7 , baseline
of 1.0 to 1.2. Hematocrit of 35.5 with MCV of 80.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with presumptive
diagnosis of recent tracheal bronchitis
complicated by overlying congestive heart failure. She was treated
with doxycycline and never spiked a fever in-house. Her cough was
essentially nonproductive and thus sputum was not sent. She was
diuresed progressively and responded well symptomatically to this
diuresis. Her pulmonary examination improved. The patient's
examination was complicated by some asymptomatic bradycardia into
the 40s , particularly at night while lying down. On admission , her
Digoxin level was low at 0.5. An attempt to increase her beta
blocker appeared to exacerbate this bradycardia and thus she was
discharged on the same dose that she was admitted with , i.e. ,
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. Notably , even when these medications
were held , her pulse was often in the high 40s or low 50s without
symptoms and remained less than 60 even while walking some of the
time. Her thyroid stimulating hormone was measured and was normal
at 3.13. The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine were thought
secondary to her congestive heart failure and in fact , her
creatinine decreased with diuresis. Recent iron studies in 2/30
were suggestive of anemia of chronic disease and her hematocrit of
35 on review was towards the low end of normal range during the
past year.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition. Discharge medications were EC-ASA 325 mg
p.o. q.d. , clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
q.d. , doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. times five days , NPH insulin 8
units q.a.m. , start 50 units q.a.m. and 8 units q.p.m. , Zestril 20
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Hytrin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. ,
Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , Demadex 100 mg p.o. q.d. , Cozaar 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. She
will follow up with Dr. Fiermonte in one week in his clinic.
V.N.A. will check the patient's weight , pulse and blood pressure at
home. They will also check the patient's potassium and creatinine
and call in abnormal results to Dr. Fiermonte .
