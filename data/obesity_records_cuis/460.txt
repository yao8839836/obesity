Discharge Date:
SERVICE: PI'NI MANGER ENE FRANDECREST CAN MEDICAL
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: ASPIRATION PNEUMONITIS.
IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 43 year old man with
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , recently
discharged from Pagham University Of ICU on November , 2001 ,
who returns for hypercarbic respiratory failure , presumed due to
aspiration.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43 year old man
with a complicated past medical
history , but a recent long hospitalization during the month of September
2001. He was initially admitted to the ENT service at that time
with lingual tonsillitis that was complicated by difficulty
handling secretions. During this admission he had an episode of
desaturation which prompted transfer to the MICU on May , 2001.
He was also febrile at that time with a productive cough. He was
treated with clinda and levo and intubated on October . He had an
acute course of prolonged intubation with extubation finally on January .  Post extubation he was heavily sedated , with waxing and waning
alertness , but gradually became more able to follow commands.
The patient was discharged to Vancor on 10/10 with still some
depressed level of mental status. On the day of admission he
developed increased respiratory difficulty and increased
secretions. This was new since his discharge. He became acutely
tachypneic to the 40s and his oxygen saturation dropped into the
80s on 100% nonrebreather. His mother reported that his lungs
"sounded junky." He spiked a fever. Hypotension to a systolic
blood pressure of 70 was also noted. For this reason he was
transferred to Pagham University Of for further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
( 2 ) Status post CVA with residual
right-sided weakness. ( 3 ) Epilepsy. ( 4 ) Noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. ( 5 ) History of mitral valve repair in 1996.
( 6 ) Irritable bowel syndrome. ( 7 ) Gout. ( 8 ) History of left
atrial clot , status post thrombectomy.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lived previously in a group home and
is a nonsmoker. He has a close relationship with
his mother.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 103.2 , heart rate
100 , blood pressure 101/40.
Vent Settings: SIMV with a rate of 20 on 100% FIO2. Arterial
blood gases - pH 7.4 , pCO2 44 , PO2 120. Generally , this was an
intubated , sedated man who appeared comfortable. HEENT: Exam
unremarkable. NECK: Without jugular venous distention or
lymphadenopathy. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. LUNGS: Bronchial breath sounds bilaterally ,
right greater than left , decreased air entry on the left. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , nondistended , normoactive bowel sounds , no rebound
or guarding. EXTREMITIES: Warm with 2+ distal pulses.
LAB STUDIES ON ADMISSION: Sodium 156 , potassium 5 , chloride 117 ,
bicarb 28 , BUN 49 , creatinine 2.4 ,
glucose 171. Hematocrit 34.5 , white count 16.05 , platelets 226.
INR - 1.5.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Pulmonary. The patient arrived at the Pagham University Of intubated. He had a history of pulmonary hemorrhage
on his previous admission. However he was more easily extubated on
10/27/01 and after that time continued to exhibit and inability to
handle his secretions. He did , however , maintain good saturations
on progressively diminishing amounts of oxygen via nasal cannula.
By the time of discharge , he was able to maintain an adequate
oxygen saturation on room air. He underwent placement of a PEG
tube on 2/3/01 in order to feed him without aspiration after a
speech and swallow study showed that he had problems with
aspiration.
2. Cardiovascular. The patient was managed with metoprolol and
Captopril , which was titrated up during this admission. His
blood pressure was well controlled at the time of discharge. His
hypotension that characterized his presentation did not recur at
all during his hospitalization.
3. Infectious Disease. The patient was to complete a 21 day
course of vancomycin from his prior admission but had ongoing
fever and positive blood cultures for Staph epi. He completed an
additional seven days of vancomycin and was treated with Flagyl for
seven days for his aspiration pneumonia. He was briefly also
treated with ampicillin early in his hospitalization. By the time
he completed his 28 day course of vanco , the patient had
defervesced and had no signs of infection.
4. Heme. The patient came to Pagham University Of
anticoagulated with Coumadin. He however was transitioned to
heparin so that he might be more able to get procedures if needed.
He continued on heparin with an easily managed PTT. After his PEG
tube placement , he was transitioned to Lovenox and Coumadin. He
will be discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin. He will need to be
transitioned to Coumadin alone once his INR is therapeutic.
5. Neuro. The patient continued on his seizures medicines -
Valproic Acid and Neurontin - during his admission. He had no
evidence of seizure activity. His mental status improved
progressively after intubation , however it was clear that he had
deficits in swallowing , significant enough to require the PEG tube.
On discharge he was awake and alert and interactive.
6. Disposition. The patient was felt to benefit from acute rehab
and was transferred to rehab at the conclusion of his
hospitalization to enjoy aggressive PT and OT.
