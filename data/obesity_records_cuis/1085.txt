BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
**CC:falling episodes
**HPI: 64 yo M s/p head assault-blunt trauma ( L crown ) 1/9 w/ possible
LOC. Reports frequent falling , n/v , with one ED visit in 4/20 , neg eval
by neuro. No prodrome , assoc w weakness , no CP , no palpitations , no
jerking movements , no incontinence. C/o h/a almost daily for last 3
wks , mostly on L side to post.+ blurry vision.
**PE on discharge: afeb , 80 , 120/70 , not orthostatic. RR 14 , 94-97% RA.
Surgical R pupil. No JVD. RRR S1S2 , III/VI cres/decres ejection murmur at
RUSB. CTAB. +BS , soft NTND. No edema. +gait imbalance.
**Studies: CXR-negative , Head CT-negative. Echo-EF 65-70% , + mild to
moder AS , valve area 1.4 , mean aortic vavle gradient 47. EKG NSR @ 70bpm ,
nml axis/intervals , on ST changes.
**Consults: Neuro ( Dr. Picariello ) , Psych ( Dr. Kriticos ) ,
**Hosp Course by System:
1 ) Cards: Ischemia: Low suspicion for ACS given sxs , however ruled out
for ACS. Pump: Pt with low SBPs on admission in 80s-90s , increased to
120s-130s with hydration. B-blockers , nitrates , ACE-I held on admission
given low BPs. Low dose B-blocker restarted HD 3. ACE-I restarted at
half dose on HD4 given pt's renal dysfunction/hypotension on admission.
Can be uptitrated as outpt. Will continue to hold nitrate for now , may be
restarted by PCP if needed; as currently with SBPs in 120s-130s do not
think pt will tolerate right now. TTE results as described above. Mild to
moderate AS , no indication for surgical correction , very unlikely to be
cause of pt's falling episodes. Pt to follow up with outpt cardiologist.
Rythym: Monitored on telemetry throughout hospitalization. On HD 4 , pt had
short run of NSVT ( 9 beats ) with associated chest tightness lasting for a
few seconds. His vital signs remained stable at this time and an EKG taken
immediately after showed NSR at 67 beats per minute with no changes
from previous ekg's. Given that he was largely asymptomatic with stable
vital signs , has normal EF , his Magnesium was repleted and he will follow
up with his outpt. cardiologist.
2 ) Pulm: On admission pt had roncherous lung exam with normal chest
X-ray. Improvd after neb treatment. O2sats mid to high 90s on RA , with
no O2 requirement during hospitalization.
3 ) Renal: Admitted with Cr of 2.4 , decreased to 1.1 on HD 2 after
hydration. FeNa on admission &lt;1% suggesting pre-renal etiology. Held pt's
NSAIDs given renal failure on admission.
4 ) Neuro: Pt has clear gait instability. Had work-up in January 2005
including MRI/MRA head , neck which were negative. Pt was re-evaluated by
Neurology who felt sxs not indicative of cerebellar disease , felt
possibly post-concussive syndrome. To follow up with outpt Neurologist.
RPR negative. Utox/serum tox negative.
5 ) Heme: Hct 33 ( around baseline ) , anemia work up negative , manual smear
normal. Guiaic negative. Should be followed as outpatient.
6 ) GU: Pt with hx of bladder neck stenosis. Evaluated by GU. No post void
residual , so only recs were follow up with outpt Urologist ( Dr. Tonsil )
in 1 month. With UTI , resistant to flouroquinolones. Being treated with
Nitrofurantion 100mg op bid x 2 weeks. To have repeat urine studies with
Dr. Tonsil 9/10 after tx.
7 ) Endo: Cortisol nml , TSH normal , covered with RISS.
8 ) GI: No emesis since admission. Tolerated regular diet well. LFTs nml ,
amylase sl incr , lipase nml.
9 ) Psych: Evaluated by psych who recommmended tapering benzos , however pt
refused until discussed with outpt psychiatrist. Attempted to contact
outpt MD without success. Pt unclear about exact benzo regimen , received
0.5mg alprazolam qid which may be slightly less than home regimen. No
signs of withdrawal.
10 ) Pain: Has chronic pain from reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Good pain
control with oxycodone 10mg q6 prn.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please continue to take your antibiotics ( Nitrofurantoin ) until 10/5/05.
We made the following changes to your medications:
1 ) Decreased Lisinopril in 1/2 ( decreased to 5mg )
2 ) Stopped Toprol and started Metoprolol - this is at a lower dose so your
blood pressure won't get so low.
3 ) Stopped your Isosorbide. You can discuss restarting these medications
with your primary care doctor. You should follow up with your cardiologist
in the next 2 weeks. We also started you on a baby aspirin.
