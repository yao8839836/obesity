Discharge Date: 1/25/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: GRAM NEGATIVE ROD BACTEREMIA.
PROBLEMS: 1. APLASTIC ANEMIA. 2. HEMOCHROMATOSIS.
CHIEF COMPLAINT/IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 34 year-old woman
with a 22 year history of aplastic
anemia , transfusion dependent for 13 years , complicated by
hemochromatosis , now with gram negative rod bacteremia.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 34 year-old woman
diagnosed with aplastic anemia 22
years ago. The patient never had a potential donor for transplant
and was immediately treated with immunosuppressive therapy for
aplastic anemia using steroids without efficacy. The patient
suffered complications from steroid use , including avascular
necrosis , resulting in bilateral hip replacements as well as
chronic bony damage to her shoulders for which she uses pain
medications. For the past 13 year , the patient has remained
transfusion dependent and requires a few units on packed red blood
cells on an every two week basis and platelet transfusions whenever
she develops epistaxis. In September of 1998 , the patient developed
diabetes mellitus. The patient had already been known to have an
elevated ferratin due to blood transfusions from years previously.
However , when she had been started on Desferal in the past , she
developed a port-a-cath infection and ultimately leakage of
Desferal to the surrounding skin , which resulted in extrusion of
her port-a-cath through her skin. She was therefore off Desferal
for a number of years. The patient presented in mid September of 1998
with a blood glucose in the 500 to 600 range , associated with
polyuria , polydipsia , and a 19 pound weight loss. An abdominal CT
scan was performed at that time , which was consistent with iron
overload. The patient's ferratin was noted to be the 7 , 000 range.
The patient was begun on Insulin therapy and Desferal 24 hours a
day. A port-a-cath was placed in the patient's left upper chest.
The patient's Desferal was given at 2 grams per 24 hours. She had
a gradual decrease in her Insulin requirements by 50%. In April of
1998 , the patient went on vacation to Tamp Park for two weeks.
Toward the end of her stay , she developed an infected port-a-cath
and was readmitted to the Pagham University Of in early
April with a port-a-cath infection. At that time , four out of four
blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus aureus. Because of concern
of the long term sequelae of Staphylococcus aureus infection , the
patient was treated with Nafcillin for six weeks. The patient did
well on Nafcillin with resolution of her fevers. The patient was
readmitted to the Pagham University Of on October , 1998 to
July , 1998 for a two day history of fevers to 101 associated
with the development of a painful perirectal abscess. The abscess
was assessed and required surgical drainage after a platelet
transfusion to increase the patient's platelets to 42 , 000. The
patient underwent an incision through the Survtheast Centex Health Care .  By
July , 1998 , the cultures from her abscess grew gram negative
enteric rods , sensitive to Cipro. All of the patient's blood
cultures were negative. Speciation of the gram negative rods
revealed Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient was discharged home on
Ciprofloxacin , which she took for an additional ten days after
discharge. Since September , 1998 , the patient had been off all
antibiotics and the plan was for Athmann to have another set of blood
cultures drawn to document resolution of all infection prior to the
consideration of putting in a new central access , such as a
Hickman. The patient was seen at the Skill Snerkernfairmri Rehab
on the day prior to admission and reported that she had been
entirely afebrile without chills. The patient also noted that her
blood sugar was well controlled on a stable regimen of Insulin in
the 24 hours after she was seen in the clinic. Two out of four
blood cultures that were drawn in the clinic revealed gram negative
rods. The patient was therefore asked to return to the Pagham University Of for treatment of gram negative rod bacteremia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Aplastic anemia. 2. Hemochromatosis.
3. Diabetes mellitus. 4. Avascular
necrosis , status post bilateral hip replacement in October of 1997
and July of 1997. 5. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy
for high grade SIL in 1997. 6. History of hepatitis B and
hepatitis C due to transfusions. 7. Multiple port-a-cath
infections in the past.
MEDICATIONS: 1. Insulin 65 units q. a.m. of NPH and 15 units q.
a.m. of Regular , 10 units of Regular subcutaneously
pre-dinner , and 20 units of NPH at bedtime. 2. Desferal 2 gram
intravenously q. 24 hours. 3. Percocet two to three tablets every
two to three hours p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a previous history of alcohol use
up to five year prior to presentation. The
patient is a single mother of three children , ages 12 , 8 , and 8.
FAMILY HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus in many extended family members.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a young African-American
female in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils
equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
movements were intact. Clear oropharynx. NECK: No
lymphadenopathy. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. Left previous
port-a-cath size is well healed. There is no induration or
tenderness at her right PICC line site. ABDOMEN: Benign. BACK:
No spinal tenderness and no costovertebral angle tenderness.
RECTAL: Recent perirectal abscess shows evidence of good
granulation tissue with a slight induration around the site and no
tenderness or warmth on palpation. EXTREMITIES: No lower
extremity edema. VITAL SIGNS: The patient was afebrile. The
patient's temperature was 99.8. Blood pressure was 116/80. Heart
rate was 76. Respiratory rate was 20. Oxygen saturation was 100%
on room air.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Drawn at Skill Snerkernfairmri Rehab on
2/8/98 , the patient's white blood cell count was 2.1 , hematocrit
18 , platelets 2 , 000 , with a differential showing neutrophils 23 ,
bands 2 , atypicals 1 , The patient had an ANC 483 , sodium 138 ,
potassium 4.6 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 24 , BUN 11 , creatinine
0.8 , glucose 266 , magnesium 2.2 , LDH 1 , 029 , AST 145 , alkaline
phosphatase 227 , total bilirubin 1.4 , and direct bilirubin 1.0.
The patient was admitted to the Oncology Service. The patient had
received 1 gram of Ceftazidine at the Skill Snerkernfairmri Rehab
for gram negative rod bacteremia with no clear source. The patient
was switched to Levofloxacin while awaiting speciation of the
bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: 1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient's
chest x-ray on admission revealed no
evidence of infiltrate. Blood cultures done on 2/8/98 revealed
four out of four bottles growing Bacillus. On 5/11/98 , blood
cultures from the PICC line grew Bacillus as well as from the
peripheral blood growing Bacillus. Urine cultures were negative.
An abdominal CT was performed to determine the source of gram
negative bacteremia , and was unrevealing for the course of
infection. There was a comment made of small liver lesions with a
question of estuta flow phenomenon. An Infectious Disease
consultation was obtained as the patient was completely
asymptomatic and afebrile in the hospital on Levofloxacin.
Recommendations were made by Infection Disease to discontinue
Levofloxacin , which was done on 2/15/98 . Blood cultures were
obtained on 1/3/98 , which revealed no evidence of Bacillus from
the peripheral blood or the PICC line. The patient's right PICC
line was discontinued and a PICC line was inserted in the left
side.
2. HEMATOLOGY: The patient's hematocrit was 18 on admission. The
patient was transfused and her hematocrit improved
to 24 on 5/11/98 . The patient had platelets of 4 on 5/11/98 . The
patient received one bag of platelets with improvement to 43. The
patient was continued on Desferal while in the hospital at 2 gram
q. 24 hours.
3. ENDOCRINE: The patient was continued on her home Insulin
regimen with the maintenance of adequate blood
sugars. There were no complications during her admission.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Insulin 65 units of NPH q. a.m. , 15
units of Regular q. a.m. , 10 units of
Regular pre-dinner , and 20 units of NPH at bedtime. 2. Desferol 2
grams intravenously q. 24 hours. 3. Percocet two to three tablets
q. two to three hours p.r.n. pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Rossie K Mankoski . The patient will also follow-up
with Dr. Langseth for placement of a Hickman if evidence of negative
blood cultures one week after discharge.
