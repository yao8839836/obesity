DIET: The patient is currently on a house diet. TPN was d/c'ed on the day of
discharge.
ACTIVITY: He may walk as tolerated.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Incarcerated chronic ventral hernia status
post sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann's operation.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Ercolano in two weeks and
Dr. Aluqdah who is the attending in two weeks. He should also follow up with Dr.
Pavek , cardiology in 2 months , and Dr. Sampey , GI in 2-4 weeks.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old male admitted for an
incarcerated chronic ventral hernia , postoperative day 6 , status
post sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann's operation.
Hospital course was complicated by postoperative acute
respiratory failure , respiratory acidosis with metabolic
acidosis , pleural effusion , hypokalemia , myocardial infarction ,
thrombocytopenia , and delirium. He has a known history of penile
cancer status post penectomy complicated by perineal
urethrocutaneous fistula , chronic anemia requiring transfusions ,
non-insulin-dependant diabetes , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , obesity , and recurrent UTIs. The patient
had a suprapubic catheter placed by Urology. His postoperative
course otherwise was alright. He started having atrial
fibrillation on 7/28/07 , initially remained stable with normal
blood pressures. He was transferred to the floor on 7/28/07 ,
wherein he developed rapid ventricular response to 120. On
6/6/07 , he began hypotensive with systolics of 70. Cardiology
was consulted. He was initially treated with Lopressor and
diltiazem drip. He remained hypotensive despite IV boluses. He
was switched to amiodarone mode and drip , but again he became
hypotensive. Therefore he was transferred to the unit and given
a digoxin load and was transferred for a possible
electrocardioversion. He remained asymptomatic throughout the
day with low blood pressures. In the ICU , he was again started
and maintained on amiodarone IV. He tolerated it without a
problem. He did have an episode of bright red blood from his NG
tube in the ICU and GI was consulted. They felt given that his
hematocrits have stabilized after two units of packed cells , he
did not need to be urgently scoped. He was started on Pepcid IV
and a Nexium drip , and had hematocrit measured q.6 h. , which
remains normal. He was transferred back to the floor on these
medications and was started on TPN after a PICC line was placed
and continued to do well. He was scoped by GI on 3/24/07 , which
showed diffuse gastritis thought to be due to the NG tube , and
two ulcers turned out bleeding. Postprocedure , he was started on
Carafate and was transferred to Nexium p.o. after he was taking a
diet. Again , his PICC line was safe on 4/15/07 and he was
started on TPN on 9/25/07 .  The NG tube was removed on 3/24/07
and his diet has been slowly advanced. He is being discharged on
TPN as his total caloric needs are still not being met by p.o.
nutrition and he is in good condition on discharge.
He was not anti-coagulated for his Atrial Fibrillation due to his risk of GI
bleeding , as decided by GI.
