BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Ms Hirschhorn is a 71F with DM , CAD , s/p 3vCABG , s/p RCA stent in 10/22 ,
CHF( EF=45% in 10/22 ) , h/o bradycardia now with AICD/Pacer , s/p R-CEA ,
s/p ? TIA , who presents with dizziness , ataxia x 24H.
Pt denies CP , SOB , palpitations. Pt denies melana; BRBPR. NO new meds ,
no N/V/F/C. This is unlike anything she has had in the past.
In the ED , labs were all within normal limits. While on a monitor she
had an episode of bradycardia to the 40s. Dr. Dominguez of
the EP service interogated the device and indicated that it was
working properly with no arrhythmias. Telemetry in the ED also did
not record the bradycardic episode , suggesting that perhaps it was an
artifact. Pt's toxicology screen was negative. Her vitals in the ED w
ere 98.0 , 55 , 176/60 , 18 , 98%RA. No dysmetria; no dysdiadocokinesia;
negativ e Romberg's sign.
Hospital Course:
1. CV: pt ruled out for MI; 24H telemetry showed no arrhythmias.
Pt's BB was held while in house because of worry about
bradyarrhythmia , hypotension. Continued antihypertensive and CAD
treatment with with Cozaar , Lasix , Norvasc , Isosorbide , Digoxin ,
Amiodarone. Pt is also on Coumadin , Plavix , and ASA , which was
continued in house. Pt was discussed w/ pt's cardiologist , Dr.
Fiermonte who indicated this was not a new complaint in the patient and
also that she has been non-compliant in the past. PT was on Coreg but
this was held prior to admit for low BP's. Pt was hypertensive w/ SB
P 150's while inpt but we will d/c pt off Coreg and defer to Dr.
Fiermonte for reinstitution of beta blockade
2. NEURO: pt's neuro exam was normal with no focal signs , and no signs
of cerebellar dysfunction. Nevertheless given her significant vascular
risk factors there was concern for vertebral-basilar insufficiency.
MRI/MRA was not possible given pt's AICD/pacer. Upon discussion w/
team CT/CTA were deferred given pt's renal insufficiency and risk of
contrast nephropathy coupled with our feeling that any findings would
not change pt management. This will be discussed with pt's PCP , Dr.
Buck Moose .
3. ENDO: pt was continued on home insulin regimen with coverage with
insulin sliding scale. Pt was found have a TSH of 158 FT4 1.8 , FT3 56.
Upon discussion w/ pt , she revealed that she had previously been
diagnosed and begun on replacement but did not know what it was for and
subsequently stopped it on her own. Pt started on synthroid to be f/u
w/endocrine. This may be the etiology of her symptoms.
4. Prophylaxis: Nexium; pt was already anticoagulated with ASA , plavix
and Coumadin.
5. Disp: Pt to follow-up w/ Dr. Fiermonte for managment of CHF/BP , and
with Dr. Blackgoat for f/u of potential neurovascular etiology of symptoms.
Pt to f/u with endocrinology for managment of hypothyroidism.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. f/u endo for management
2. f/u w/ Dr. Fiermonte for possible reinstitution of beta blockade and
CHF/BP management
3. f/u Dr. Blackgoat for w/u potential vertebral-basilar insufficieny with
recognition of risk of iv contrast nephropathy vs utility of
information
