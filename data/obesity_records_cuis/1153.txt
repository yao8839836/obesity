??__04:13___?? antegrade/retrograde cardioplegia. Patient is in
normal sinus rhythm , rate of 80 at end of case. There were no
complications. The patient was transferred to the unit in stable
fashion with lines and tubes intact. 9/6/06 , postop day 1 , the
patient was slow to ambulate. Postop day 2 , responded to gentle
diuresis. Meds changed to p.o. Postop day 3 , chest tubes and
wires were discontinued. Somnolence resolved. Fluid overloaded.
Loss of secretions. Able to clear up. Postop day 4 , failed
speech and swallow. Wires discontinued. Hemodynamically stable
in Afib since evening. Rate controlled. Diuresing well.
Transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day 4.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: Mildly confused immediately postoperative , now
resolved , neurologically intact.
Cardiovascular: Cardiac meds: Aspirin , Lopressor , and Coumadin.
Hemodynamically stable on Lopressor , now back in Afib , stable
rate of 90s , respiratory ventilated greater than 24 hours
postoperatively. Extubated on postoperative day 1 without
complication. Currently on 5 liters of O2 and some pulmonary
edema , improving with Lasix 20 mg IV t.i.d. and diuresis.
GI: Failed speech and swallow. Bedside Dobhoff placed. Started
on Osmolite tube feeds at 20 mL an hour. Awaiting nutrition
input for goals. Needs video swallow to assess swallow function.
Renal: Appropriately diuresing , maintaining 1.5 liters negative
until preop weight.
Endocrine: Stable on CVI. Hematology: Anticoagulation.
Coumadin and aspirin for atrial fibrillation.
ID: No issues. Prophylactic antibiotics for chest tubes. In
step-down unit proceeded to progress well. Postop day 4 strict
n.p.o. per speech and swallow for aspiration with all
consistencies , currently on sitter. Postop day #5 , the patient
self discontinued the Dobbhoff feeding tube twice last night
requiring meds IV today until tube replaced and KUB confirmed tip
this afternoon. Dobbhoff currently okay to use. We will resume
tube feeds. Heart rate elevated to 90s-130s and also run of VT ,
which was asymptomatic. Rechecking electrolytes , BP stable.
Preop EF of 45%. Ordered echo to assess postop EF given run of
VT , which was 9 beats. Normal a.m. electrolytes. Remains on 3
liters of O2 , diuresing well. Speech and swallow will reassess
next week. Strict n.p.o. for history of aspiration. Afebrile.
White count improved to 10.9 , remains on sitter for mild
confusion. Plan rehabilitation when ready. Postop day 6 ,
chronic Afib , rate has been difficult to control , patient was on
Lopressor 75 mg p.o. q.i.d. postop via Dobbhoff tube. Patient
has self discontinued Dobbhoff several times and is quite
sensitive to missed dose of oral Lopressor so dosing IV Lopressor
currently. Heart rate is still a bit elevated at 100-120s , BP
stable. Mental status improved off sitter. Remains on 1.5
liters of O2 junky cough , unable to produce sputum. Afebrile.
White count stable at 10.4.
Chest x-ray looks okay. No echo ordered for her fellow. Repeat
electrolytes. Titrate beta-blocker. We will reorder echo if VT
recurs. PT consult placed. Postop day 7 , past video swallow
exempted. Dobbhoff out on sitter because he is having suicidal
ideations. He has been quite hyperglycemic with blood sugar in
350 range. EMS following. Screening for rehabilitation. Postop
day #8 , running a bit fast in Afib. Increase Lopressor. Mood
has improved. Will most likely be able to discontinue sitter
soon. Screen for rehabilitation. Postop day #9 in Afib running
between 90-100 , had been on a sitter up until this a.m. for
suicidal ideation a couple of days ago eating well. Screening
for rehab. Postop day 10 , rate controlled Afib/room air.
Patient followed by psych for postoperative confusion/possible
suicidal ideation. Patient stable on Celexa. Patient's UA from
7/12/06 with probable enterogram-negative rods. Started Cipro
x3 days. Continue rehabilitation screen. Postop day 11 , Afib ,
rate controlled/room air. Patient's chest x-ray with no edema ,

Celexa ordered per psych. Awaiting rehabilitation bed. Postop
day 12 Afib/room air doing well with blood pressure. Seen by
psych and recommend follow up with them post DC for memory
studies. No new ??__??. Ready for rehabilitation. Just waiting
for acceptance and bed. Postop day 13 , rate controlled Afib/room
air. Patient waiting for rehab bed. On Coumadin for Afib ,
followed by psych for confusion/delirium and note by them that
