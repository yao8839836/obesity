BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
ID/CC: 68 yo retired social worker with cardiac risk factors of obesity ,
hypertension and possible family history admitted with atrial flutter and
found to have ACS.
HPI: Pt is fairly inactive at baseline but over the three days prior to
admission had noted shortness of breath with walking even a few steps.
On night prior to admission , she had severe shortness of breath , unable
to breathe in comfortably even sitting bolt upright; this was accompanied
by substernal chest pressure and profuse diaphoresis. She went to MMC
clinic the following morning reporting the shortness of breath was found
to be in atrial flutter with 2:1 block and 2-3mm lateral ST depressions
in V4-V6. The first EKG in the ED showed new deep , symmetrical T-wave
inversions in V4-V6 , 1-mm concave down ST elevation in lead III and
similar contour in II and aVF although not elevated. First TnI 7.39 ,
MB 21.2. Went to cath lab and found to have active thrombus in the OM
distribution; received drug-eluting stents to OM1 , OM2 , and LCX and
monitored overnight in the CCU with 18 hours of post-procedure
eptifibatide.
Home meds: metoprolol , norvasc , combivent
PEx: On transfer to floor , exam notable for faint bibasilar crackles ,
JVP 14 , S1S2 intermittent gallop , no LE edema.
EKG: atrial flutter with variable block , bifascicular block ( LAFB and
RBBB )
Assessment and Hospital Course:
68 yo woman with non-ST elevation MI and atrial flutter with variable
block , s/p facilitated PCI with 3 stents in OM and LCX distribution.
1 ) CV Ischemia: s/p NSTEMI: ASA , clopidogrel , atorvastatin 80 , atenolol
100 , captopril converted to lisinopril. Pump: CHF , with atrial flutter
and ACS the likely precipitants. Initially required O2 to
maintain sat &gt; 90 but gradually titrated to off. Diuresed well with Lasix
80 IV bid , negative 1 L/day for 3 days and then converted to PO lasix 40.
TTE showed normal LV size , concentric LVH , EF 50% , abnormal septal
motion , mild diffuse HK. Nl RV size/function , mild LAE , mild RAE. No AI ,
mild-mod MR , mild TR. PA 29 + RA. Trace pulmonic regurgitation. Nutrition

restriction. Rhythm: Initially rate-controlled on beta-blocker and
diltiazem for goal rate in 60s; she will be discharged on atenolol 100 mg
po QD. She had several 10-14-beat runs of NSVT , treated with aggressive
lyte replacement particularly in light of long QTc. Initiated heparin and
discharged on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. She was not considered an ICD
candidate based on her EF.

elevated this admission; a hemoglobin A1C was 6.2%. Likely to have
glucose intolerance and will benefit from weight loss.
