PERSONAL HISTORY: The patient is married and has three children ,
all alive and well. She is still menstruating.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is working as a secretary. She denied
tobacco and alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's father died of diabetes and
congestive heart failure. Her mother died of a
myocardial infarction at the age of 62.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient had a nocturnal cough , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , plus/minus exertional
dyspnea , leg edema. There was no melena. There was no dysuria.
There was no hematuria. There was no hemoptysis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a middle-aged white female
who was lying in bed in mildly acute
distress. The temperature was 98.1 degrees. The blood pressure
was 150/75 at the Emergency Department , but it was only 90/60 when
measured on the floor. The pulse rate was 72. The respiratory
rate was 18. The oxygen saturation was 97% on two liters. The
conjunctiva were pale. The sclera were icteric. The pupils had
light reflexes , prompt and symmetric. The mouth examination
revealed the mucous membranes to be moist. The neck was supple.
The jugular venous distention was 4.0 cm. There was no parotid
fluid. The thyroid was not enlarged. On chest examination , there
was symmetric expansion. Breath sounds were clear. There were no
basilar crackles. On heart examination , there was a regular heart
beat. There was no split S-2. There was no increased P-2. There
was no heart murmur heard. On the abdominal examination , the
abdomen was soft and was slightly distended. The liver and the
spleen were not palpable. The bowel sounds were normo-active. The
extremities were freely moveable. There was mild pitting edema.
There was no cyanosis , and there was no clubbing of fingers. The
Homans' sign was negative. There was no palpable cord of the legs.
The left calf was slightly tender , but the dorsalis pedis pulse was
positive on both sides , although slightly less on the left side
than on the right side. On neurological examination , there were no
focal neurological signs.
LABORATORY DATA: The sodium was 141. The potassium was 4.0. The
chloride was 106. The bicarbonate was 27.0. The
BUN was 19.0. The creatinine was 0.6. The blood sugar was 91.0.
The CK was normal times three. The troponin-I was 0.05. The CKMB
was not measured because of normal. The CBC showed a WBC of 9.78 ,
a hematocrit of 37.8 , a platelet count of 315.
A chest x-ray revealed no cardiomegaly and no pulmonary congestion.
An EKG originally showed normal sinus , with no acute ST-T changes.
The ABGs with two liters oxygen showed a PO2 of 74.0 , an SO2 of
94.4 , a pH of 7.37 , a PCO2 of 39.0.
Other studies included a cardiac echo which showed normal left
ventricular size and normal systolic function. The ejection
fraction was 54%. There was normal right ventricular size and
function. There was no acute right heart overload. There was no
significant valvular dysfunction , and there was no pericardial
effusion. The V-Q scan on April , showed intermediate
probability for PE. The cardiac catheterization on April ,
showed normal coronary arteries and normal pulmonary pressures.
Leni's studies on April showed no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis. A pulmonary angiogram on August showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.
HOSPITAL COURSE: After the patient was admitted to the Floor , she
developed hypotension , with the blood pressure
Pdown to 80/50. The hypotension was responsive to normal saline
challenge , 2.0 liters. The arterial blood gases showed a large AO2
gradient. After three hours on the Floor , the EKG showed Q-R-S and
ST-T changes at Lead 3 and AVF , suggestive of right ventricular
strain , so right ventricular infarction was suspected. Emergency
cardiac echo showed that there was no acute right heart overload ,
and that both chambers of the heart were normal. Cardiac
catheterization was normal. Leni's showed no evidence of deep
venous thrombosis. A pulmonary angiogram was done , and it showed
no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Other causes of epigastric pain
such as pancreatitis and hepatitis was ruled out because of normal
levels of amylase , lipase and liver function. The patient's chest
pain was partially relieved with Motrin.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include enteric-coated aspirin , 81.0
mg po q day; Atenolol 50.0 mg po q day;
TUMS , 1 , 250 mg po t.i.d.; Motrin 800 mg po q6 hours; Maalox 15.0 ml
po q6 hours prn for indigestion; multivitamin , one tablet po q day;
Zoloft 25.0 mg po q day; Axid 150 mg po b.i.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged in stable condition , and
she will be followed at her primary care physician's
office and cardiologist for a scheduled visit in one week. The
patient has also had study about ANA and lupus screen as well as a
rheumatoid arthritis screen. These results will be followed up as
an outpatient. The patient's thyroid function was totally normal.
