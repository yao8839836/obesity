gastric band placement without complication. The pt was transferred to
the PACU in stable condition. Her pain was well controlled with PCA
analgesia on POD0 and transitioned to po elixir analgesia following a
negative upper GI studfy exhibiting no leaks. Her diet was advanced from
NPO to stage 2 post gastric banding diet , which she tolerated with no
nausea/vomiting. On POD 1 the surgical site was examined and there were
no signs of hematoma. The pt remained hemodynamically stable and was
making good urine. At the time of discharge the pt's pain was well
controlled and she was tolerating a stage 2 diet and was afebrile with
