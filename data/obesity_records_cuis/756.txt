ATTENDING: COLASAMTE , ISABELLE EVON MD
DATE OF TRANSFER FROM INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: February , 2005.
VASCULAR SURGEON: Dr. Rossie Mankoski
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: On January , 2005 , open amputation of right
fourth toe and on November , 2005 , CABG x 4 ( LIMA to LAD , SVG1 to
acute marginal; sequential graft: Left radial connecting LIMA to
ramus and circumflex ).
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old male
with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and a
longstanding history of peripheral vascular disease. He
presented to an outside hospital on October , 2005 , complaining of a
nonhealing ulcer of his right foot for one year. At the outside
hospital ABI showed 0.32 on the right and 0.43 on the left with
PVRs normal only at the thigh. The patient also underwent a
cardiac workup at the outside hospital. MIBI showed reversible
ischemia involving the basal , mid , and apical segments of the
anterior wall. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45%
with possible septal hypokinesis. The patient was transferred to
Pagham University Of for further management. The patient
was seen by the Vascular Surgery Service and underwent amputation
of his right fourth toe on January , 2005. Cardiology and
Cardiovascular Surgery were also consulted for the findings of
cardiac workup at the outside hospital. The patient underwent a
cardiac catheterization on April , 2005 , which showed left main
disease with three-vessel disease. Lower extremity angiogram was
also completed on April , 2005 , which showed a totally occluded
right external iliac artery with reconstitution of the right
common femoral artery; right hypogastric collaterals perfusing
the leg; right profunda femoral artery with proximal disease and
distal reconstitution; right superficial femoral artery with
severe mid vessel focal stenosis , and 2 vessel runoff. The plan
was for coronary bypass to be followed a right lower extremity
revascularization at a later time. The patient also underwent
carotid ultrasound on February , 2005 , preoperatively , which showed
no hemodynamically significant disease in the right carotid
artery and a 55% stenosis in the left carotid artery.
PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC STATUS: Class II heart failure.
Preoperatively , the patient was in normal sinus rhythm.

HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation; dentition without evidence of infection; and no
carotid bruits.
Chest: No incisions.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs;
pulses 2+ bilaterally in the carotids and radials; on the left 1+
femoral , absent DP signal , positive PT signal; on the right ,
positive signals in the femoral DP and PT; normal Allen's test
bilaterally with a questionable noncompressible vessel on the
right.
Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally.
Abdomen: No incisions , soft , no masses.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY RESULTS: Sodium 139 , potassium 3.9 ,
chloride 105 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 9 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 138 ,
magnesium 1.5 , white blood cell count 10 , hematocrit 37.5 ,
hemoglobin 13.1 , and platelets 263. PT 14.9 , INR 1.1 , PTT 26.2 ,
and hemoglobin A1c 10.6. UA was consistent with infection.
Cardiac catheterization performed at Pagham University Of

90% proximal circumflex; 70% ostial OM1; and 90% mid RCA.
Echocardiogram on March , 2005 , showed an ejection fraction of 45%
with trivial mitral insufficiency , trivial tricuspid
insufficiency , and a pulmonary pressure of 24 mmHg.
Preoperative EKG on April , 2005 , showed normal sinus rhythm at
75 beats per minute.
Chest x-ray on November , 2005 , showed clear lung fields.
The patient underwent CABG x 4 ( LIMA to LAD , SVG1 to acute
marginal; sequential graft: left radial connects LIMA to ramus
and circumflex ).
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: The patient remained neurologically intact
throughout his ICU course. He was receiving Tylenol , ibuprofen ,
and Toradol p.r.n. for pain.
Cardiovascular: The patient required external pacing for
bradycardia on postoperative day #0. His intrinsic heart rate
increased. On the day of transfer , his heart rate was in the
60's sinus rhythm with blood pressures 120s to 180s over 70s to
80s. He was receiving diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. for the radial
artery graft and his Lopressor was being titrated. At the time
of transfer , he was receiving Lopressor 18.75 mg p.o. q.i.d. The
patient was transferred from the ICU with his atrial and
ventricular pacing wires in place.
Respiratory: The patient was extubated on postoperative day #0.
At the time of transfer , he was receiving oxygen 2 liters per
minute via nasal cannula with an O2 saturation of 98%.
GI: The patient had a gastric dilation on chest x-ray in the
morning of postoperative day #1. This was asymptomatic and
resolved spontaneously. On the day of transfer , he was
tolerating p.o.'s. and his diet was being advanced. He was
receiving Pepcid for GI prophylaxis.
Renal: The patient's fluid balance on the day prior to transfer
was negative 187 cc. His sodium was 138 on the day of transfer
with a potassium of 4.1 , BUN 11 , and creatinine 0.8. He was
receiving Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.i.d.
Endocrine: The patient was on a Portland protocol while in the
ICU. At the time of transfer , he had no insulin requirement.
The patient was being followed by the Diabetes Management
Service.
Heme: On the day of transfer , the patient's hematocrit was 30.7
with a platelet count of 225 and an INR of 1.4. He was receiving
aspirin and Zocor.
ID: Postoperatively , the patient was continued on vancomycin ,
levofloxacin , and Flagyl for his history of right toe gangrene.
The patient was ambulating on his heels. Wet-to-dry dressing was
being done to the right foot t.i.d. On the day prior to
transfer , the patient's T-max was 98.3 with a white blood cell
count of 14. His chest tubes had an output of 360 cc the day
