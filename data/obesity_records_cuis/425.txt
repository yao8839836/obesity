Discharge Date: 4/2/1999
IDENTIFICATION: A 73-year-old man with a past medical history
significant for extensive coronary artery disease , diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and smoking , who presents with
chest pain , and is admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Defont has a long history of
coronary artery disease with a coronary artery bypass graft in
1989 , left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery , saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one , saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft
to the obtuse marginal artery three. In 1992 he had unstable
angina , and catheterization showed that the distal grafts were
totally occluded. He had a redo coronary artery bypass graft with
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and the
left circumflex , his postoperative course being complicated by
atrial fibrillation. In 1996 , he had a non-Q wave myocardial
infarction with a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of
the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one , and saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery. In 1997 , he had a repeat
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with an saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal one , and an saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery. Most recently he was admitted in
October of 1999 with an exercise tolerance test mibi , for which
exercise for four minutes and seven seconds he had inferolateral
ischemia. Echocardiogram showed an left ventricular ejection
fraction of 50 percent , anterior inferior posterior hypokinesis , 1
to 2+ mitral regurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of
42.0 millimeters of mercury plus right atrial pressure of 6.
Catheterization showed 100 percent occlusion of his saphenous vein
graft to the diagonal one , which was stented. His right coronary
artery and diagonal one were totally occluded. His left anterior
descending artery was 95 percent. His left circumflex was clear.
At that time he was randomized to the Toscine Medical Center trial. At baseline ,
Mr. Defont denies exertional chest pain or any angina. He does get
short of breath with one flight of stairs , or going uphill for one
block. He gets claudication after walking three house lots.
He was in his usual state of health until one day prior to
admission when he noted the onset of 4/10 aching chest , shoulder ,
and left arm pain while watching television , and it was associated
with shortness of breath. He sat still , waited for it to
dissipate. At 7:00 p.m. , he took one sublingual nitroglycerin with
a decrease of pain. At 11:00 p.m. , he took one sublingual
nitroglycerin and went to sleep before noting no change in the
pain. He was driving to his appointment with Dr. Mcpeck , his
primary cardiologist on the morning of admission , with the return
of the chest pain for one to two minutes and it was gone
spontaneously. At Dr. Sabaj office , he was noted to have new
lateral T wave inversions and was sent down to the Emergency Room
for admission.
Mr. Defont denies any associated nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis ,
exertional or pleuritic chest pain currently , fever , chills , or
cough. He does report stable lower extremity edema , but denies
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or palpitations. He has
poor exercise tolerance.
His cardiac risk factors include the following: Age , diabetes ,
hypertension , cholesterol , smoking , and family history.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history is as follows: 1.
Hypertension. 2. Diabetes with fingersticks of 120 to 160 at

fibrillation. 5. Chronic renal insufficiency. 6. Benign
prostatic hypertrophy. 7. Peripheral vascular disease , status
post carotid endarterectomies bilaterally. 8. Status post
cholecystectomy and inguinal hernia repair.
ALLERGIES: His allergies include Quinaglute , lisinopril , and
verapamil. He thinks they cause gastrointestinal upset.

Finasteride 5 q.d. 10. Colchicine 0.6 milligrams p.r.n. 11.
Aspirin 81 milligrams q.d. 12. Restoril 30 milligrams p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He occasionally drinks alcohol. He has a 120 pack
year smoking history , quit in 1989. He is a retired machinist and
lives with his wife of 53 years.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of a myocardial infarction at 77.
His sister had a coronary artery bypass graft at 70. He has many
brother , one of whom is 71 who had a myocardial infarction at 44 ,
and one who had a coronary artery bypass graft at 70.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination in general , he is a
pleasant elderly man in no apparent distress. His vital signs , his
heart rate was 96 , blood pressure 174/64 , saturating 95 percent on
room air. He had carotid bruits bilaterally. His lungs were
clear. His jugular venous pressure was less than 5.0 centimeters.
His PMI was nonpalpable. He had a regular rate with a 1/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without radiation.
Extremities , he had a left femoral thrill and bilateral femoral
bruits. He had 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. His
extremities were warm without edema. His neurologic examination
was non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: His labs on admission were significant for a BUN
and creatinine of 49 and 1.3 , hematocrit of 40.5. His urinalysis
was normal. Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 53 , left
axis deviation , right bundle branch block , no hypertrophy , no Q ,
new T wave inversion in V4 through V6. Chest x-ray was clear. His
Troponin was 0.45 , CK was 197 , his myoglobin was 159 , his INR was
1.5.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 73-year-old man with
extensive coronary artery disease , who presents with one day of his
typical anginal pain , multiple bruits , new lateral T wave
inversions , admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction. His
hospital course by issue:
1. Cardiovascular: Mr. Defont was catheterized on the evening of
admission , and he was found to have the following. He was found to
have a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one was 100 percent
occluded. Saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery
was open. His left main was 30 percent occluded. His left
anterior descending artery was 99 percent occluded. His diagonal
one was 100 percent occluded. His left circumflex was 80 percent
occluded. His left subclavian which was supplying his left
internal mammary artery was 100 percent occluded. He was taken
back to the Catheterization Laboratory the next day with Dr.
Reedy who performed a left subclavian artery stent and also a
left brachial artery angioplasty. Mr. Defont tolerated this
procedure well. He had no return of his chest pain after the
procedure , and his pulses remained normal , he had no groin
hematoma. He was placed on Plavix. He also continued his aspirin ,
and his Coumadin was restarted after the heparin and intravenous
TNG which were originally put on board to prevent arterial spasm
after the procedure , were discontinued. His next cardiovascular
issue was his blood pressure. He was originally on atenolol 25
milligrams q.d. , we added back Cozaar 25 milligrams q.d. which he
had been on before admission and had been stopped a month prior
because he had low blood pressure with a systolic in the 80s.
However , his first day here , his systolic pressure was 120 to 130 ,
and restarted it. He had no problems with that. His blood
pressure a few days after admission was in the 150 to 160 systolic
over 70 , and amlodipine was added to his regimen. He was continued
on his outpatient doses of Lasix 160 milligrams q.a.m. and
mitozalone 5 q.d. He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
2. Renal: After the first catheterization , Mr. Charpia creatinine
went from 1.3 to 1.8. However , it went back to 1.3 the next day.
After the second catheterization it went up to a peak of 4.3.
However , his urine output remained at 100 to 150 cc an hour with
Lasix 100 milligrams intravenous p.r.n. , in addition to his morning
dose of 160 milligrams q.a.m. , and he was given normal saline
intravenous fluids to equalize his ins and outs. He did not have
any signs of cholesterol emboli , no levator reticularis , no
eosinophilia , no blue toes.
3. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: He had a low potassium on the
morning of admission with a potassium of 2.7 because he had missed
his outpatient K-Dur of 60 mEq q.d. He had no symptoms , he had no
electrocardiogram changes. He was repleted throughout admission
and was kept on his outpatient dose of K-Dur and had no problems
further with potassium. In addition , he was discharged on a
standing dose of magnesium because his magnesium was routinely low
throughout admission , on the order of 1.5 to 1.8.
4. Hematology: On the day after his catheterization , his
hematocrit dropped from 33.0 to 28.0. He was transfused two units
with an appropriate bump back to 33.0. He tolerated this without
any problems.
5. Diabetes: He was maintained on his outpatient regimen of NPH
30/10 and 4 regular q.p.m. , and Rezulin. His blood sugars were
maintained throughout admission.
6. Genitourinary: He was maintained on his finasteride for benign
prostatic hypertrophy. In addition , he had a biopsy prior to
admission which had shown chronic prostatitis. His outpatient
urologist had recommended ciprofloxacin 500 milligrams b.i.d. for
thirty days. Since the hospital does not carry ciprofloxacin , we
put him on Levofloxacin 500 milligrams q.d. He had no return of
those symptoms.
7. Musculoskeletal: On hospital day number four , he developed
excruciating point tenderness in the medial aspect of his right
knee. The knee did not appear swollen or red , and he had no source
of trauma. However , it was thought it might be a recrudescence of
his gout. The next day it was more warm and slightly swollen.
Colchicine helped somewhat , and he was then put on a prednisone
taper starting at 40 milligrams and tolerated this well.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged to home in stable condition on
October , 1999. He has follow-up appointments with his primary
doctor , Dr. Stayner , on August , 2000 , his primary cardiologist ,
Dr. Mcpeck , on January , 1999 , and Dr. Reedy who performed
the procedure on the subclavian artery on January , 2000.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: His medications on discharge are the
following: 1. Cozaar 25 milligrams q.d. 2. Restoril 30
milligrams q.d. q.h.s. p.r.n. 3. Nitroglycerin 0.4 milligrams
p.r.n. chest pain , sublingual , may repeat times three q.5 minutes.
4. Regular insulin 4 units q.p.m. , NPH 34 units q.a.m. 10 units
q.p.m. 5. Rezulin 400 milligrams q.d. 6. Aspirin 81 milligrams
q.d. 7. Coumadin 5 milligrams q.d. 8. Clopidogrel 75 milligrams
q.d. 9. Magnesium oxide 280 milligrams q.d. 10. Colchicine 0.6
milligrams p.r.n. 11. K-Dur 60 mEq q.d. 12. Lasix 160
milligrams q.d. 13. Mitozalone 5 milligrams q.d. 14. Atenolol
25 milligrams q.d. 15. Atorvastatin 20 milligrams q.h.s. 16.
Finasteride 5 milligrams q.d. 17. Ciprofloxacin 500 milligrams
