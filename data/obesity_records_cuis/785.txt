HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 47 year-old woman
with a long-standing history of asthma
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who now presents with
cough , shortness of breath , increased wheezing times three days.
The patient is a morbidly obese woman with a long-standing history

venous thrombosis in 1997. Three days prior to this admission , the
patient noted that she felt unwell with a cough productive of
yellow sputum , increased shortness of breath and wheezing. She
attributed the cough and wheeze to exposure to dust and mold on
Monday at the nursing facility at which she lives. The patient was
diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection at the skilled
nursing facility at which resides and she received one dose of
Doxycycline 100 mg on the night prior to admission. She was

ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to horse serum which leads to
anaphylaxis.
FAMILY HISTORY: Father had a cerebrovascular accident at age 35 ,
history of arterial thromboses. Mother has breast
cancer. Both parents are still living.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a nursing home separated from
her husband. She smokes three to four cigarettes
a day which is down from one pack per day. No significant alcohol
history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was a
morbidly obese woman breathing with
difficulty lying in bed. Her vital signs included a temperature of
98.5 degrees , heart rate 98 , blood pressure 110/80 with a
respiratory rate of 20 , oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Her
physical examination was significant for the following: Her skin
had no rashes , no cyanosis. She was normocephalic , atraumatic with
no nasal discharge , no sinus tenderness , moist , pink , mucous
membranes with no exudate or erythema. Her neck was supple and
non-tender with no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distension
and no thyromegaly. Her chest examination revealed diffuse
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes bilaterally with a prolonged
expiratory phase , no crackles or rales. Her diaphragm elevated
symmetrically on expiration. Cardiac examination was regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , gallops or rubs.
Her abdomen was soft , obese , non-tender with positive bowel sounds ,
no masses were palpated. Her examination was limited secondary to
obesity. Her extremities were warm with no clubbing or cyanosis.
She had marked edema of the lower extremities bilaterally with left
greater than right. Dorsalis pedis pulses were trace bilaterally.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies were notable a white blood cell
count of 11.3 , hematocrit 36.7 and platelet count 317.
PT was elevated at 23.5 , PTT 42.2 , INR 3.8. Electrolytes included
a sodium of 141 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN
17 , creatinine 0.9 and a glucose of 108. Calcium was 9.6 ,
magnesium 1.9. Theophylline level was 14.7. Her EKG showed normal
sinus rhythm with 95 beats per minute. PR , QRS and QTC intervals
were all within normal limits. Her chest x-ray , PA and lateral ,
showed low lung volumes but no pneumonia or congestive heart
failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Respiratory: The patient's symptoms were
most likely secondary to asthma in the setting of
bronchitis given her long-standing history of asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and her recent exposure to mold and
dust. A pulmonary embolus was deemed less likely given her INR of
3.8 and her oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. She was started
on Prednisone 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. and her medical regimen included
Uniphyl 800 mg b.i.d. , Lasix 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Albuterol
nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and q.1h. p.r.n. , Flovent 660 mcg b.i.d. ,
Flonase 1-2 sprays q. day , Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d. and Atrovent
nebulizers q.i.d. The patient was also placed on Levofloxacin 500
mg q. day for her infection. The patient remains afebrile
throughout her course. Her sputum culture grew out 4+ polys ,
moderate gram , positive variable cocci in clusters and few gram
negative rods. The patient continued to improve on her medical
regimen with continued cough and sputum production. She was placed
on two liters oxygen nasal cannula on August , 2000 overnight for
comfort. Her peak flow was less than 120 on admission and improved
to 240 on May , 2000 , 230 on October , 2000 and peak flow of 320 on
May , 2000. The patient remained short of breath although this
improved over her course and she also improved in movement with
diminished wheezing. On discharge , the patient had a peak flow of
320 , saturating 97% on room air with a respiratory rate of 20. The
patient was discharged today to her nursing home , continuing on her
nebulizers and inhalers as well as the Prednisone 60 mg t.i.d.
today , day five and then continuing a slow taper thereafter with 50
mg t.i.d. times five days , then 40 mg t.i.d. times five days , 30 mg
t.i.d. times five days , 20 mg t.i.d. times five days and 10 mg
t.i.d. times five days.
2 ) Infectious disease: The patient is on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
q. day. Today is day number five and she will complete a seven day
course of Levofloxacin at her nursing home.
3 ) Hematology: The patient had an INR of 3.8 on 9 mg b.i.d. of
Coumadin upon admission. In the past , she has been known to have
an increased INR with the addition of antibiotics due to decreased
Coumadin clearance. Thus , on admission , we decreased her Coumadin
dose to 8 mg b.i.d. However , on January , 2000 , her INR climbed to
5.0 , so we again reduced her Coumadin to 6 mg b.i.d. Her evening
dose of Coumadin was held as well. The patient's INR was noted to
be 2.0 on October , 2000 and the Coumadin dose was again raised to 9
mg b.i.d. On May , 2000 , the patient's INR was 4.5. The
patient's AM dose of Coumadin was ordered to be held and her
Coumadin dose was readjusted to 7 mg in the AM and 8 mg in the PM
while on the antibiotics. She was ordered for two more days of
Levofloxacin and then two days after she stopped the Levofloxacin ,
INR should be rechecked and Coumadin dose readjusted to 9 mg b.i.d.
with INR being checked every day.
4 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient continued on
her weight reduction medications including Xenical 120 mg b.i.d.
and Adipex 30 mg q. day. The Phentermine was discontinued to be
restarted at the nursing home. The patient's weight was noted to
be 395.2 pounds.
