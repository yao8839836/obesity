TESTS/PROCEDURES Chest CT 9/10 ( compare to 9/8 ): Per pulm c/w
scarring/persistent changes after recent multifocal PNA 9/8 , no e/o
of new primary lung path , ground glass c/w pulmonary
edema ---
HOSPITAL COURSE: SOB secondary to CHF exacerbation and fluid overload. No
evidence of infectious pulmonary process contributing to present
symptoms. CXR and CT changes are c/w scarring/changes from recent
multifocal PNA 9/8 , with additional ground glass c/w pulmonary edema.
No clinical or radiologic e/o primary lung etiology for DOE. Pulmonary
team assessed patient and reviewed non contrast chest CT from this
admssion - they confirmed that current sx are likely 2/2 pulomonary
edema. Patient was diuresed with Lasix just over 3L net negative with
improvement in his oxygen saturations ( rest and ambulation ). At time of
d/c JVP 10cm. Pt will diurese further at home on Lasix 80 BID ( he had
not been taking his lasix for 2d prior to d/c. HTN was
another issue on admission but is most likely due to patient taking wrong
dose of Coreg ( taking QOD instead of BID ). On a BID Coreg regiments , BP
much better controlled. Etiology of his CMP still remains unclear despite
extensive outpt W/U. Additionally , discrepancy between Echo and
Cardiac MRI is puzzling. No concern for ischemia on this admission ,
clean cath in 2002. Started on ASA and continued on Lipitor. Renal function
remained stable but impaired. He is being evaluated for dialysis as an
outpatient but no vasc access placed yet. Phoslo , nephrocaps continued
here. Finally , pt continued on coumadin for h/o recent DVT ( 9/8 ) and INR
remained in therapeutic range. Low suspicion for PE on this admission. He
was discharged in stable condition with outpatient follow up instructions..
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Be sure to take your Coreg as instructed.
2. Call your doctor if your shortness of breath gets worse or if you have
chest pain , fevers or dizziness.
3. Take your coumadin as regulated by the anticoagulation
clinic.
4. Check your weight daily and take your lasix as prescribed.
5. Call you primary care doctor and cardiologist Monday morning 9/7 .
Please see one of them this upcoming week.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up with your primary care doctor , your cardiologist and the renal
clinic.
