DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Katke is a 32 year old woman who
presented with intermittent chest pain
and shortness of breath of two days duration. Her cardiac risk
factors include a positive family history but no diabetes , no
cholesterol , no hypertension , and no history of tobacco use. The
patient was in good health until two days prior to admission. At
that time , she noted 2/10 substernal chest pain radiating to the
left arm accompanied by shortness of breath and dizziness. There
was no nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. The pain lasted
approximately 45 minutes and did not change with activity or
position. The pain and shortness of breath recurred approximately
two times that day. She had a fourth episode on the morning of
admission while watching television. She went to the Healtstone Hospital where there was no improvement. An EKG there showed
flipped T waves across her precordium. The patient improved with
oxygen there. The pain recurred during an ambulance ride to the
Pagham University Of where it was again relieved with
oxygen. The patient has no prior history of chest pain ,
palpitations , or shortness of breath. She denies orthopnea ,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , edema , or previous dyspnea on
exertion. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic low back pain. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cesarean section in 1986. CURRENT
MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: Tylenol with Codeine. FAMILY
HISTORY: Both her mother and father died of myocardial infarction ,
the mother at age 50 and the father at age 74. The patient has a
sister who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft at age 37. The
patient denies alcohol , tobacco use , and drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese Hispanic woman who
was in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure was 110/80 and her pulse was 100 and regular. HEENT:
Examination was within normal limits. NECK: Supple. CHEST: Clear
to auscultation and percussion. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination
showed no jugular venous distention , S1 and S2 were regular with no
S3 , S4 , or murmur , and carotids were 2+/2+ with no bruits. ABDOMEN:
Obese , soft , and non-tender with good bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES:
Femorals showed no ruits , there was no cyanosis , clubbing , or
edema , and there were 2+/2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: The patient was alert and
oriented , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , and strength and
reflexes were symmetric.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , cholesterol was 202 ,
triglycerides 316 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.3 ,
hematocrit 42.2. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm at a
rate of 92 and an axis of negative 12. Intervals were 0.17 , 0.07 ,
and 0.35. There was evidence of poor R wave progression and
flipped T in leads V1 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 32 year old woman with no prior cardiac
history who presents with chest pain at rest. She
has a strong family history and high triglycerides which makes us
question if there is a genetic predisposition for coronary artery
disease. Her EKG is clearly abnormal , however , it is unclear if
these are new or old changes. Patient was put on a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol and started on Nitrol Paste ,
Lopressor , and Aspirin. Her CPK initially were 243 with 2 MB and
later decreased to 202 , 141 , 132 , and 88. An echocardiogram done
during this admission showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild
hypokinesis of the inferoposterior walls , and slight apical
hypokinesis of the right ventricle with a question of prior
infarction. The patient underwent an initial exercise test during
which she went three minutes and 23 seconds on a standard Bruce
protocol. There was no evidence of ischemia. On a second exercise
test , the patient completed seven minutes of a Bruce protocol
stopping secondary to dyspnea and leg fatigue. An EKG during the
protocol showed minimal ST depressions in the inferior leads with
recovery and flipped T in the anterior leads. The impression was
that there was no evidence for ischemia although the patient did
not achieve a maximal heart rate. There appeared to be diminished
exercise tolerance. Patient was discharged with a follow-up
appointment in the KTDUOO Clinic.
