PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Myocardial infarction. 2. Non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus. 3. Chronic renal insufficiency. 4.
History of renal carcinoma.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES: 1. Cardiac catheterization on August , 1998.
2. A stress mibi with viability study on May , 1998. 3.

BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of
a 35 to 40 pack year smoking , and non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus for 14 years. The patient has been waking with occasional
shortness of breath over the preceding three weeks , and having
chest pressure lasting 30 seconds to a minute that resolves
spontaneously. The night prior to admission , the patient woke from
sleep with severe dyspnea , chest pressure , and diaphoresis. He
denied any nausea , pain , or radiation of his symptoms. The
paramedics were called and the patient was noted to have an oxygen
saturation of 70 to 80 percent on room air. He was intubated in
the field and taken to Norap Valley Hospital .  The initial
electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in V1 to V3 , with T wave
inversions in V3 through V6. He was treated with tPA at Norap Valley Hospital .  He was treated with intravenous Lasix for presumed
congestive heart failure and hypertension , and was admitted to the
Cardiac Care Unit. He was placed on nitroglycerin drip which was
titrated to his blood pressure. He was successfully extubated the
following morning. He was started on metoprolol , digoxin ,
lisinopril , and a heparin drip. He underwent an echocardiogram
which showed an ejection fraction of 25 percent with global
hypokinesis. He remained pain-free throughout his hospitalization ,
and had no further episodes of dyspnea. He was transferred to the
I Warho Hospital on February , 1998 for further management of
his myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of renal carcinoma status post
nephrectomy in 1994. 2. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3. Mild hypercholesterolemia which is not currently being treated.
4. Renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy with a baseline
creatinine of 2.0.
MEDICATIONS: Glyburide. At Norap Valley Hospital : 1. Heparin. 2.
Aspirin. 3. Insulin sliding scale. 4. Lisinopril. 5.
Furosemide. 6. Zocor. 7. Lopressor. 8. Digoxin. 9. Pepcid.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 to 40 pack year history of tobacco.
He rarely drinks alcohol , and denies any drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , overweight man in
no acute distress. Vital signs: The patient had a temperature of
98.4 , heart rate 77 , blood pressure 143/78 , respirations 18 , and
oxygen saturation of 91 percent on three liters by nasal cannula.
HEENT examination showed pupils that were equal , round , and
reactive to light and accommodation. Conjunctiva were anicteric.
Extraocular movements are intact , and his oropharynx was clear.
Neck examination was supple with his jugular venous pressure at
approximately 8.0 centimeters. There was no lymphadenopathy.
Chest examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally , with no
rales. Heart examination was regular rate and rhythm with a
non-displaced PMI and a positive S3. There was no murmur.
Abdominal examination showed an obese , soft abdomen with positive
bowel sounds. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. No
masses were palpated. The extremities were warm with no edema. He
had 1+ femoral pulses bilaterally. His left lower extremity had a
1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. His right lower
extremity had a 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse with a nonpalpable
posterior tibial pulse. Neurological examination , he was alert and
oriented x three. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 are intact and
symmetric. He had 5/5 strength throughout. Deep tendon reflexes
were 2+ throughout with downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies from P Therford Hospital showed a sodium
of 139 , potassium of 4.5 , chloride 109 , CO2 of 21 , BUN of 22 , and
creatinine of 2.2. Glucose was 236. Liver function tests were
within normal limits with an alkaline phosphatase of 95 , total
bilirubin of 0.4 , and AST of 39. CPKs were 151 , 163 , and 163 with
no MB fractions done. His TnI was less than 0.2 to 0.3. He had a
white count of 14.2 with a hematocrit of 42.9 and platelets of 222.
His triglycerides were elevated at 303 , and his cholesterol was
elevated at 265 with an HDL fraction of 32 and an LDL fraction of
172. His prothrombin time was 11.3 , partial thromboplastin time
28.4 , and INR 0.85. Urinalysis was negative. An electrocardiogram
was performed at the time of admission which showed resolution of
the ST elevations. He had T wave inversions in V2 through V4 , and
flat T waves in V5 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Myocardial Infarction: He was
continued on a heparin drip , Lopressor , and lisinopril. His
digoxin was discontinued at the time of admission. Nitroglycerin
was given only p.r.n. He remained symptom-free throughout his
hospitalization. His elevated cholesterol was treated. He
underwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1998 which showed 50
percent left main obstruction and 90 percent complex mid left
anterior descending. His right coronary artery was occluded. The
patient did well both during and after the catheterization. The
patient underwent a stress mibi test with a viability study on January , 1998 which showed ischemia during his exercise tolerance test.
The mibi showed severe ischemia in 11/25 segments , as well as an
infarct on the apical septum , apex , and base of the inferior wall.
Options were considered including coronary artery bypass grafting
and angioplasty. After a long discussion with the Cardiology
Service , Cardiac Surgery , the Renal Service and the patient , the
decision was made to proceed with angioplasty. On July , 1998 ,
the patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of his right coronary artery with zero percent residual
blockage. He also had two stents into his left anterior descending
with zero percent residual blockage. The patient tolerated the
procedure well.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma for
which he underwent a nephrectomy in 1994. He also has chronic
renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy. As surgery was being
considered for his cardiac disease , a Renal consultation was
obtained to evaluate his renal status. He underwent a renal
ultrasound showing an exophytic mass in his solitary kidney. This
was very concerning for recurrence of carcinoma. He then underwent
an MRI study which showed a nonenhancing mass in the kidney which
was most consistent with a hyperdense , proteinaceous cyst. This
was reassuring , though cancer could not be ruled out 100 percent.
The patient's renal function remained stable throughout his
hospitalization.
3. Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was
placed on an insulin sliding scale during his hospitalization. He
was instructed to continue with his Glyburide , and to follow-up as
usual with his outpatient provider.
The patient was discharged to home on October , 1998 , one day
following his second catheterization procedure. The patient did
very well following the procedure , and had remained pain and
dyspnea-free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. 2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Lopressor 12.5 mg
p.o. three times per day. 4. Nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual
tablets , one sublingually every five minutes x three as needed for
chest pain. 5. Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.h.s. 7. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8. Ticlid 250 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with his
primary care physician , and to call the office to schedule an
appointment. The necessary follow-up with Cardiology and with the
nephrologist will be scheduled as an outpatient.
