The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , CAD status post MI in 2000 who presented with an ST
elevation MI to the Emergency Room on 10/13/06. He was brought
to Cath where he was found to have in-stent thrombosis in his LAD
which was aspirated and bare-metal stent was placed in his LAD
and another stent was placed in his diag-2. He had been arrested
multiple times in V-Tach requiring CPR and cardioversion. In the
Cath Lab , he was given bicarb , placed on the epi drip , given
Lasix and was intubated. He was thought to aspirate at the time
of intubation secondary to vomiting. A bedside echo revealed
global hypokinesis with an EF of 35%. He , at that time , was
placed on a balloon pump , dopamine 16 , amio 1 , propofol 1 , and
Integrilin and brought to the floor. On the floor , his blood
pressures were difficult to control and his ??___?? readings
indicated a wedge pressure of 47. His MAPs to keep them over 60
required max dopamine , max Levophed , epinephrine and dobutamine.
His family was aware of his prognosis and was there at the time
of his arrest at 3:30 in the morning. CPR was initiated , and
ACLS was done until the family decided to terminate the ACLS and
the time of death was 3:47 a.m. on 10/13/06. At that time , exam
revealed no breath sounds , no heart sounds , and nonreactive
pupils. The cause of death was thought to be cardiogenic shock
secondary to ST elevation MI.
