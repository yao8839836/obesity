BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: 59F w/ CAD recently RCA/OM1 stent admitted with
nephrolithiasis for pain control. HPI: hx chronic pain syndrome on
percocet and morphine ( also for OA ) , who recently had R heart
cath and PCI 1 wks ago. During that admission , was noted to have
hematuria --&gt; renal f/u. C/O L flank pain x 2 days , planned for CT.
In Cards clinic on DOA , noted poor pain control. admitted by ED for
pain control. Got ASA , no IVF. morphine. PMH: chronic pain syndrome ,
FM on mscontin tid. CHF , diastolic dysfunction. OSA , CPAP. HTN , CAD ,
chol , mult MI , stent x 3 1 wk ----------
EVENTS: in ED OBS appeared comfortable on dilaudid and
morphine. ----------
STATUS: resumed on home pain regimen , required additional 25 mg oxycodone
overnight.
--------- STUDIES:
I- CT showed: kidney stones on R , by CT ureter in ED , no hydro.
stones are old , not clear that this is causing her current pain.
-------- IMP: 59F with CAD and recent PCI now with
nephrolithiasis and pain control problems. PLAN:
1. CV: gave lasix to increase filtration and UOP , while
increasing IVF to keep up w/ euvolemic state.
- cont outpt regimen - asa , statin , bb , acei. 2. GU/RENAL: increase
UOP w/ IVF and Lasix. 3. ID: does not appear to have systemic
infection. Inflammation of ureter. tx UTI ( UA+ ) with cipro 250 mg PO x 7
days. Started 4/23 , ending 3/6
4. FEN: Diabetic , low salt , low fat/cholesterol diet 5. Pain control with
home regimen of MScontin and
oxycodone. Switched to 45 mg oxycontin PO q12h instead of MS contin upon
discharge as patient requiring frequent PRN for breakthrough. Of note ,
back pain crosses lumbosacrum , radiates down legs bilaterally , and to
groin bilaterally. This distribution is consistent with a
more mucskuloskeletal etiology of pain , rather than R-sided
nephrolithiasis.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You must continue your medications , especially aspirin and plavix to
protect your stent. Continue the Ciprrfloxacin for your UTI. Follow up
with your doctors or call to reschedule the appointments. Call your
doctor or return to the ER if you have fever , chills , sweats , worsening
shortness of breath , chest pain , or any other problems.
