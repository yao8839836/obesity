BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
IDENTIFICATION: 73F w/ a h/o recent anterior STEMI ( 9/22 ) c/b apical
aneurysm , apical thrombus , and ischemic cardiomyopathy w/ most recent EF
35% admitted from home w/ increasing DOE and fatigue.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mrs. Tortorella is a lovely 73yo woman who presented in 9/22 with 3 days of
epigastric and chest pain and was found to have a STEMI. She
subsequently underwent DES to ramus and LAD. Flow through the LAD was
only TIMI 2 by the end of the procedure. Course was complicated by
post-MI pericarditis , apical wall thinning , and mural LV thrombus.
She was discharged initially to short-term rehab , then subsequently went
home w/ weekly f/u w/ cardiac rehab. While at short term rehab , she was
treated w/ doses of lasix as high as 120 mg IV. Following discharge from
rehab , she was ultimately taken off of diuresis b/c of "dizzy spells" she
was experiencing while on lasix.
She did well off lasix until 2 weeks ago , when she was noted to have
decreased exercise tolerance and increasing fatigue at cardiac rehab.
She says that she is usually able to ambulate for 15 minutes on the
treadmill; she hasn't been able to do this for the past 2 weeks b/c of
dyspnea and fatigue. This has been accompanied by new-onset PND
( occurring as frequently as 3-5 times/night ) , 5 pound weight gain , and
increasing abdominal girth. She does acknowledge dietary indiscretion
this past week ( had a can of mushroom soup 4 days ago ). No orthopnea.
Mrs. Lobello cardiac rehab. contacted Dr. Jonte ( her primary
cardiologist ) a few days ago to inform her about Mrs. Lobello DOE and
increasing fatigue. Starting 2 days ago , she was placed on lasix 40 mg.
Since then , she has taken a total of 5 doses. She came to urgent care
this PM and was noted to desat. to 85% w/ ambulation in the setting of
fluid overload. She was subsequently admitted.

LABORATORY DATA AT ADMISSION:
1. Na+ 144; K+ 4.1; Cl- 105; CO2 31; BUN 20; creatinine 1.0; glucose
73
2. ALT 40; AST 27; ALK 61; TB 0.4

4. Ca2+ 9.7; Mg2+ 1.6
5. WBC 6.62; Hct 35.9; PLT 213
RELEVANT STUDIES:
EKG: NSR. Q waves in II , III , and aVF; along w/ V1-V4
CXR: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
7/5/2006 ECHO: Mildly dilated left ventricle ( systolic diameter: 3.57
cm and diastolic diameter: 5.89 cm ). Overall left ventricular function
moderately reduced w/ EF 35%. Anteroseptal wall is akinetic from
midventricular level to apex , and hypokinetic at the base. Focal basal
inferior aneurysm ( new from 7/5/05 ) and the apex is focally
aneurismal. False tendon , but no obvious thrombus seen. Global right
ventricular systolic function mildly reduced. Trace TR. Trace TR. PASP
17 mmHg+RAP.
11/26 ETT: Duration 3'20'' and stopped d/t fatigue. Attained 4.7 METS.
Maximum heart rate 125 at 85% of predicted. Maximal blood pressure
130/70. ECG ST changes of accentuation of baseline ST , T wave
abnormalities. Apparently , low HR recovery. Imaging w/ large myocardial
scar in the proximal LAD territory. Small and mild myocardial ischemia
in the OM territory ( small defect involving the basal inferolateral
wall ). Post-stress EF 31%.
OVERALL ASSESSMENT: 73F w/ a h/o recent anterior STEMI ( 9/22 ) c/b
apical aneurysm , apical thrombus , and ischemic cardiomyopathy w/ most
recent EF 35% admitted from home w/ increasing DOE and new-onset PND.
Appears to be fluid overloaded , improved w/ diuresis over 3 day
hospitalization.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. CARDS PUMP: Volume overloaded w/ ischemic CMP implicated.
Initially received IV diuresis w/ lasix 80 mg IV bid and was ~2.5 liters
negative. SBP down to 80 following overdiuresis on 6/14 held diuresis
on 10/7 .  Resumed oral regimen w/ lasix 40 mg po qdaily on 10/5 .
Discharged on lasix 20 mg po qdaily. Continued spironolactone 25 mg po
qdaily. Increased lisinopril to 30 mg po qdaily to optimize heart
failure regimen at admission; changed to 15 mg po qdaily on 10/7 after
SBP dropped to 10/7 .  Also , she had apparently been taking this
inconsistently as well.
2. CARDS ISCHEMIA: No active issues. Recent ETT w/ small reversible
defect involving the basal inferolateral wall. Continued ASA , plavix ,
lipitor.
3. CARDS RHYTHM: W/ known ischemic cardiac disease and EF~35% ( down
to 31% on post-stress by MIBI ) , inclined for AICD placement ( MADIT ).
Discussed w/ EP and she will see Dr. Grinstead as an outpatient. Repeat Echo
4/3/06 w/ estimated EF 40%. Defer decision on EP eval to primary
cardiologist Dr. Jonte
4. PULM: Hypoxia in the setting of volume overload. Weaned O2 w/
adequate diuresis.
5. HEME: 9/22 course c/b LV thrombus , has been on
anticoagulation. Repeat echo. w/o thrombus , however apex quite akinetic
and contrast study with stagnant flow concerning for high risk of thrombus
recurrence. Therefore , warfarin was continued in addition to ASA and
plavix. The decision to continue these three medications is deferred to
pt's primary cardiologist , Dr. Jonte . Pt has INR drawn locally but is
managed by the PUO coumadin clinic and will f/u with them.
6. ENDO: Initially on regimen of lantus , lispro , and sliding scale.
Then patient acknowledged that she had never been on insulin the past.
Switched to sliding scale alone , transferred on metformin 500 mg po bid.
7. PPX: PPI and on coumadin until discharge.
