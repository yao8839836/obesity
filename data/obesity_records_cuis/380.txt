HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 71-year-old male with a

of 146 , MB of 1.7 , and troponin less than assay. The patient was
taken up to the surgical intensive care unit intubated. He
received 7800 units of crystalloid , 6 units of cell saver , and 2
units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively , put out 1200 cc
of urine , 175 cc out of the nasogastric tube , with an EBL of 2400
cc. He was weaned from the ventilator without difficulty on
