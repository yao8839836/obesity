Discharge Date: 2/7/2005
ATTENDING: ECKLOFF , VERNA M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Medaries is a 79-year-old female
with a history of Ehlers-Danlos , osteoarthritis and left knee
replacement in 1998 , and left hip replacement in 2002 who was leaving her
primary care physician's office and was hit by the elevator door and fell to
the ground. She suffered a left periprosthetic fracture of her left distal
femur. She was initially admitted to Hoplukes I Rehabilitation Hospital where
she was found to have , by report , a closed distal femur fracture
between her prior ORIF and TKR with no neurovascular deficits.
Operative intervention was referred by Hoplukes I Rehabilitation Hospital due
to her medical problems and she was treated conservatively with
nonweightbearing and a knee immobilizer. Her course there was
significant for a hematocrit drop requiring 2 units of PRBC's as
well as being ruled out for an myocardial infarction. In addition , she also
had a negative MIBI test. She was transferred to Pagham University Of for further management.

ALLERGIES: Kefzol causes rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives in an apartment in Adelp Mother
recently deceased. No alcohol. No tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 98.8 , heart rate
75 , blood pressure 100/50 , respiratory rate 18 , and saturations
94% on room air. No acute distress. Regular rhythm and rate.
No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Lungs , clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended.
Positive for colostomy. Left lower extremity in knee
immobilizer , swollen and tenderness to palpation. Left lower
extremity slightly externally rotated. Bilateral EHL/tibialis
anterior/gastrocnemius intact distally with 5/5 motor. Sensation
to intact to light touch and SPN/DP/sural/tibial nerves/saphenous
distributions. Bilateral 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Sodium 137 , potassium 3.6 , chloride 114 ,
bicarbonate 26 , BUN 17 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 148 , and calcium
9. White count 11.6 , hematocrit 39.6 , and platelets 170. INR
1.1 , PT 14.2 , and PTT 21.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Upon admission to Pagham University Of ,
Ms. Medaries underwent an echocardiogram to rule out any cardiac
abnormalities. Her ejection fraction was revealed to be 50% with
no wall motion abnormalities and only mild aortic insufficiency.
She was determined to be medically stable to go the operating room by Internal
Meidicine. On January , 2005 , she underwent an open reduction and internal
fixation of her left femur fracture with a LISS plate placement.
Postoperative film showed good placement of hardware and good
alignment of her fracture. Her postoperative course was
complicated only by mild hypotension ( systolic blood
pressures in the 70s ) and by shortness of breath. She was
successfully treated with fluid boluses and inhaled nebulizers
respectively. Postoperative chest x-ray revealed lower lobe
atelectasis. Once she was more mobile by postoperative day #3 ,
her blood pressure and O2 saturation stabilized. The remainder
of her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was kept on
perioperative antibiotics and as well as prophylactic Lovenox
while in house. She was kept touchdown weightbearing on her left
lower extremity. Her dressing was removed on postoperative day
#2. She was evaluated by physical therapy who worked with her to
increase her activity. She was deemed safe for discharge to
rehabilitation. Upon discharge , her left lower extremity was
neurovascularly intact. Her incision was clean , dry , and intact
and healing well. She is discharged in stable condition with
instruction to continue Lovenox and left lower extremity
touchdown weightbearing status until followup in clinic in two
weeks.
TO DO PLAN:
1. Touchdown weightbearing , left lower extremity.
2. Follow up with Dr. Compono in two weeks.
3. Continue Lovenox until next appointment with Dr. Compono .
