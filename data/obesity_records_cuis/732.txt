in approximately two weeks after having an open cholecystectomy for

bile leak from the cystic duct. The patient had an ERCP with a stent
placement by Dr. Gaylene Faniel The patient will have this removed in two
months. Otherwise , the patient is doing well with no fevers , chills , or
sweats. No nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. He is having normal bowel
movements and tolerating a regular diet. He has a midline ventral hearing

incision is healing well and the staples are taken out. He has a midline
ventral hernia in the subxiphoid region near his cardiac transplant
incision site. The hernia is somewhat symptomatic but the defect was very
