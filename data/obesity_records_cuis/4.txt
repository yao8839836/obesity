Discharge Date: 12/10/1993
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ,
HYPERTENSION.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year old male
immigrant from Ma Gosatope
with a long history of angina. He had been followed in the Sungooaks Van Heim , Iowa 05164 for years with strong indication for interventional
evaluation of his coronary artery disease. The patient had refused
and had been being treated medically inspite of the angina pattern.
Recently his angina had worsened and he agreed to undergo more
intensive workup. He was referred for elective cardiac
catheterization. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hospitalization for an
episode of chest pain in Voboville , hypertension and history
of peripheral vascular disease with claudication symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam the patient's temperature
was 97.7 , heart rate 60. HEENT: Head and
neck exam unremarkable. Lungs: Clear anteriorly. Heart: Regular
rate and rhythm , no murmurs appreciated. Abdomen: Soft , non-tender.
EXTREMITIES: No edema. Had weakly dopplerable pulses. Of note , his
physical exam was performed on his emergent admission to the
cardiac care unit after becoming unstable at elective cardiac
catheterization.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: His admission laboratory exam was
remarkable for a normal CBC and serum 20
general exam. His EKG after cardiac catheterization demonstrated
inverted T waves in III , F and some ST depression in V4-V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On elective cardiac catheterization the patient
was noted to have a 90% ostial left anterior
descending coronary artery lesion. He had EKG changes ,
symptomatically had chest pain at catheterization. He was referred
for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. An intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed. He was taken emergently to the Operating
Room where a 4 vessel coronary artery bypass was performed. There
were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively , the patient
did remarkably well inspite of his dramatic presentation. He had
no vascular complications. His intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed without incident and he had no specific cardiopulmonary
complications. His only issue at discharge was urinary retention.
He failed several voiding trials. Urology Service had consulted and
felt this was likely secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home with an indwelling Foley
catheter with follow-up arranged at CHH Urology.
MEDICATIONS: His discharge medications include aspirin 1 a day ,
iron , Colace , Mevacor 20mg q day and Tylenol #3 p.r.n. He will
follow-up with his Cardiologist , urology service and with cardiac
surgery.
