light and accommodation. There is no scleral icterus present.
Neck: Supple. There is no lymphadenopathy or masses present.
Cardiovascular: Rate is irregularly irregular. It is

right upper sternal border that is heard throughout. Jugular
venous pressure is distended and can be seen at the level of the
ear. Respiratory: There are bilateral basilar crackles.

is 1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities. There
are 1+ distal pulses in the upper and lower extremities
bilaterally. Neuro: The patient is alert and oriented x3 and
exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: At the time of admission , sodium 144 , potassium
4.5 , chloride 106 , bicarb 30 , BUN 41 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 83 ,
anion gap is 8. White blood cell count of 8.1 , hematocrit 31.7 ,
platelets 332 , 000. There are 71% neutrophils , 14% lymphocytes
and 12% monocytes. Calcium is 8.7. Urinalysis shows trace
blood , 3+ leukocyte esterase. 40-50 white blood cells , 1-5 red
blood cells , trace bacteria.
STUDIES AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION.
1. Chest x-ray shows status post midline sternotomy and CABG.
There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , which is
unchanged from prior x-rays. Right lung is clear. There is a
small left posterior pleural effusion , which has been reduced in
size compared to his previous x-ray dated 8/29/07 .
2. EKG revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm with atrial
fibrillation with a rate of 44. There is left axis deviation , a
right bundle-branch block and Q waves in II , III and aVF , which
is unchanged from an EKG in 5/3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is an 82-year-old gentleman
with a history of multiple medical problems most significantly
including recent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis , CAD
status post CABG , CHF , atrial fibrillation with a slow
ventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation with
a fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures with
concerns for endocarditis given his recent AVR. The patient was
initially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.
Blood cultures were obtained and the patient grew out
two out of two bottles of Gemella morbillorum from his blood.
Urinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000
colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cultures were also taken
from the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare MRSA ,
few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. Once blood
cultures for Gemella morbillorum returned , the patient's
antibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on
7/17/07 .  Ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. The
patient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit any
significant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.
Surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics have
remained negative to date. A TTE was obtained and was negative
for any valvular vegetation. However , given the patient's high
risk for endocarditis , a TEE was obtained , which was also
negative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. The
patient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his high
risk.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness or
chest discomfort. He does have a history CAD status post CABG
and was continued on his full strength aspirin. He was also
continued on statin.
Pump: The patient was volume overloaded at the time of admission
and was treated with 60 mg of IV Lasix. Following this , he
appeared euvolemic and Lasix was held for several days and then
gradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of IV
Lasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. QAM. At the
time of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , but
diuresing well with 80 mg daily. The patient's Losartan was held
in the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiation
of gentamicin therapy. At the time of discharge , his weight is
96.6 kg. His I/O goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. He should
continue daily weights. Of note , the patient's dry weight is
approximately 93 kg. Pt's lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.
Rhythm: The patient is bradycardic at baseline down into the
mid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refused
permanent pacemaker placement. All nodal agents should be
avoided for this reason. The patient did have several runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. Electrolytes
were checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassium
above 4. However , no other medical management was initiated
given his bradycardia.
2. Infectious Disease: As noted above , there was high suspicion
for endocarditis in this with a recent AVR. He was found to have
Gemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted above
empirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed to
gentamicin and ceftriaxone on 7/17/07 once gram-positive cocci
were speciated. The patient was initially treated for
pseudomonal UTI with five days of ceftazidime , but given that
only 10000 CFUs grew out , it was decided that ceftazidime
could be discontinued and that there would be some response to
ceftriaxone plus gentamicin. A PICC line was placed on 7/17/07
for continued IV antibiotics and the patient should continue a
full six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-week
course of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despite
both negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram
given his high risk for endocarditis.
3. GI: The patient was continued on his home dose of Protonix
and all his stools were guaiaced and were negative in house. The
patient should be continued on p.r.n. Colace.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. His Lantus was titrated up to 36 units
nightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin.
5. Renal: The patient was found to have a slightly elevated
creatinine above his baseline on admission ( 1.9 with a baseline
of 1.1 to 1.3 ). This elevated creatinine was thought to likely
be due to his CHF and poor forward flow. As the patient was
diuresed , his creatinine decreased to 1.4 at the time of
discharge. Given his creatinine elevation , however , his Losartan
was held and this should be held while the patient is on gentamicin.
6. GU: The patient has a history of BPH and at the time of
admission had a suprapubic catheter that was inserted in 4/10
due to difficulty to pass Foley catheter. The catheter was
clamped and post-void residuals were checked and were only 50 mL
and the patient was urinating without difficulty with tube clamped ,
so Urology was consulted and suprapubic catheter was pulled
without difficulty. Suprapubic wound was dressed with a sterile
dry dressing to be changed daily.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient has a
current input and output goal of 0.5 L negative daily. He is on a 2L fluid
restriction.
Electrolytes. The patient has been having twice daily
electrolyte checks to keep his magnesium above 2 and his
potassium above 4 given his arrhythmias while he is on 80 mg of
Lasix daily. This should be continued.
Nutrition. The patient was placed on a cardiac , 2-gm sodium
diet and a 2 L fluid restriction.
8. Pulmonary: The patient is to continue on Flovent and
albuterol.
9. Heme: The patient was continued on Niferex twice daily for
iron deficiency anemia. He was also found to have a very mild
eosinophilia , which should be followed.
10. Derm: The patient was found to have a skin tear on his
right hand. This is being treated with neomycin ointment and
sterile dry dressing changes daily.
11. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin
5000 units three times daily and continued on his PPI.
CODE: The patient is full code.
