gentleman who has hypertension , known
diabetes mellitus , and coronary artery disease. He underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1970 and a follow-up

vein graft. He presents now because of accelerating angina.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He underwent cardiac catheterization on 30 of January

the time of the procedure he underwent reop coronary artery bypass
grafting times three utilizing the saphenous vein graft from the
aorta to the LAD and aorta to D1 and aorta to OM 2. His postop
course was relatively uneventful. He remained hemodynamically
stable and his intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on the
first postop day. There were no problems discontinuing the IABP
and despite his peripheral vascular disease there was no problem
with the balloon pump. He continued to progress satisfactorily ,
was transferred to the Stepdown Unit , and was transferred to the
floor. He was placed back on his medication and he did have some
trouble swallowing postop but he had undergone an upper GI series
two weeks prior to his procedure which was read as normal. The
rest of his postop course was uneventful. His incisions healed
quite nicely and he was discharged on postop day six. His blood
sugar was controlled with CZI sliding scale while hospitalized. He
