HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 59-year-old morbidly obesity woman with a history of
diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with a recent
AV graft infection , sepsis , thoracic cord compression status post
fusion secondary to MRSA osteomyelitis , recurrent C. difficile infections ,
life-threatening epistaxis , who was status post embolization , who
is now admitted to the Renal Service with suspected fungemia
thought to be associated with her tunneled catheter. The
patient , however , is asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
1.. Infectious Disease: The patient had a positive blood
culture identified on surveillance blood cultures. The patient
was initially started on micafungin IV while speciation and
sensitivities were pending. The patient received five days of
micafungin IV 100 mg IV daily. Cultures then came back with
Candida glabrata that was sensitive to fluconazole. At that
time , she was converted over to oral fluconazole 400 mg once
daily. Surveillance blood cultures with fungal isolators were
sent on a daily basis while in the hospital , all of which have come back
negative to date. The patient also had her tunneled catheter line pulled on
10/1/07 .  She was evaluated by Ophthalmology to rule out
endophthalmitis and was determined not to have evidence of this.
She also received a transthoracic echocardiogram to rule out
vegetation. The patient has a history of MRSA osteomyelitis with
a cord compression status post decompression with hardware and
was continued on levofloxacin and IV vancomycin which was
scheduled to continue until 4/18/07 .  Blood cultures from
1/25/07 grew out VRE bacteremia , and the patient was at that
time converted from IV vancomycin to linezolid 600 mg orally
twice daily on 9/27/07 .  She also received one dose of
gentamicin 80 mg IV x1. A new tunneled catheter had been placed
on 3/7/07 and given that the blood cultures was VRE grew back
positive on 1/25/07 , it was certain that the new tunneled
catheter was not the source of VRE and the decision was made to treat
through the line. All subsequent blood cultures from 9/27/07
and 2/28/07 are all negative to date. The patient had one
temperature spike to 101 degrees , and she was recultured of these
cultures which were negative. She also had a repeat chest x-ray
which showed only minimal atelectasis and no evidence of
pneumonia. The patient subsequently defervesced. And has been afebrile for
over 72 hours. Also , of note ,
the patient had a history of C. difficile. She was continued on oral
vancomycin for suppression. She did continue to have numerous
loose stools during the hospitalization and C. difficile cultures
were sent twice on 6/8/07 and again on 3/7/07 , both of which
were negative. Also , of note , the patient has sacral decubitus
ulcer that was watched closely for infection.
2. Renal: As noted above , the patient's tunneled catheter was
removed as it was deemed the most likely source of her fungemia.
She was dialyzed once through her temporary femoral line and
tunneled catheter was then placed on 3/7/07 and the patient was
dialyzed approximately every two days with the last dialysis on
10/11/07 .  The patient is due for hemodialysis on 7/14/07 .
3. Heme: The patient has a history of anemia that is consistent
with chronic disease. She received 1 unit of packed red cells
during her hospitalization.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient , on admission , had right upper
quadrant tenderness with an elevated alkaline phosphatase and
GGT. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and to rule
out biliary obstruction. This study showed a normal liver. A
gallbladder with a few small stones as well as sludge ,
gallbladder wall thickness was normal. There was no sonographic
Murphy's sign , and biliary tree was noted to have a dilated
common bile duct of 7 mm that was unchanged and distal ducts were
not well seen. The intrahepatic ducts were noted to be normal.
The patient's Zocor , however , was held in the setting of elevated
LFTs. Abdominal pain resolved on hospital day 2 and LFTs trended to normal.
Also , of note , the patient had a history of C. difficile
as noted above. She continued to have diarrhea although her C.
difficile cultures were negative. She was treated
symptomatically with Lomotil. A rectal tube was also placed
given her diarrhea and increased pain with soiling of ulcer as well as risk of
infection. Rectal tube should be continued in rehab to prevent
infection of the sacral ulcers.
5. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation with RVR and was continued on her Lopressor ,
amiodarone. She did not have any episodes of rapid ventricular
rate , nor any episodes of hemodynamic instability or
hypertension.
6. Neuro: The patient has bilateral lower extremity weakness
and loss of sensation of the right lower extremity likely
sequelae of recent cord compression , per Neuro notes in the
medical record from 11/22/06 .  The patient also had an episode of
acute delirium. As a result , her Reglan was discontinued as was
her fentanyl patch and her mental status improved although she
still had baseline memory deficits. Psychiatry was consulted and
recommended tapering her Celexa and Cymbalta in the setting of
waxing and waning mental status. The patient has also been
counseled to avoid oxycodone or any other narcotics for pain
control and to try to only use Tylenol.
7. Derm: The patient has a sacral as well as right heel
decubitus ulcer. The wound nurse was consulted , and the patient
received Panafil ointment to the sacral ulcers twice daily.
Sacral wound is to be irrigated with warm saline and then Panafil
is to be applied to open areas twice daily , and then wound is to
be dressed with dry sterile dressing , all twice a day. The
patient has sutures in place from thoracic spinal fusion.
Orthopedics was consulted to remove some of the sutures.
Approximately , 50% of the sutures , however , were not ready to
come out , and the patient should follow up with Dr. Rossie K Mankoski on 1/12/07 for removal of the remaining sutures. This
area should be evaluated at least daily and dressings changed
once daily with dry sterile dressings.
8. Vascular: The patient was noted to have oozing at the site
of her old AV graft and the right antecubital fossa on 7/25 .  Vascular
Surgery was consulted and evacuated a hematoma on 7/25 .  This wound is to be
dressed with 2 x 2s , soaked to normal saline and is to be changed
three times daily. The patient is to follow up with Dr. Stacie C Halechko from Vascular Surgery in two weeks to evaluate this wound
site.
9. Psychiatry: The patient had a flat affect and was thought to
be appropriately depressed in past hospitalizations. She was
initially continued on Cymbalta and Celexa. Psychiatry was
consulted and felt that the patient was demonstrating some
delirium , but she was currently not depressed and recommended that
her Cymbalta and Celexa be tapered. She is currently in the
process of being tapered , and this taper should continue as noted
in the discharge medication section.
10. Pain: The patient was initially treated with fentanyl and
oxycodone per rehabilitation regimen. Her fentanyl patch was
quickly discontinued in the setting of one episode of acute
delirium. Her oxycodone was continued and she required
approximately 10 mg of oxycodone daily. She , however , has been
counseled to try to wean herself off of oxycodone , and use only
Tylenol for pain given propensity to delirium.
11. HEENT: The patient had a history of severe epistaxis. She ,
however , has not had any epistaxis during this admission. She
was continued on saline nasal sprays.
12. Fluids , Electrolytes , and Nutrition: The patient was seen
by Nutrition consultants. Her zinc and vitamin C were
discontinued to avoid copper deficiency. She was started on
Megace 400 mg twice daily , and she was placed on a liberal diet
to encourage p.o. intake. The patient required some electrolyte
repletion including repletion of phosphate and potassium. Of
note , phosphate should not be repleted with Neutrophos but with
sodium phosphate for phosphates less than 1.5 possibly
given the potassium load and Neutrophos. At time of discharge however patient
did not have IV acess. Patient should recieve one dose of neutraphos 1 packet
x1 upon arrival to rehab. She should then have a basic metabolic panel checked
on 2/12/07 to ensure her potassium is normal.
13. Prophylaxis: The patient was continued on subcutaneous
heparin as well as a PPI.

The patient is a full code.
