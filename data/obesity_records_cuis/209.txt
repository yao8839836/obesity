PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEART FAILURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY.
2. VALVULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY.
3. MITRAL REGURGITATION.
4. TRICUSPID REGURGITATION.
5. HYPERTENSION.
6. HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.
7. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old man with
valvular cardiomyopathy , status post
three aortic valve replacements , who presents with no acute
complaints but a progressive decline in daily function.
Mr. Yantis history begins in 9/13 when he presented with
shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the
setting of medications ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension )
noncompliance. He was found by echo to have severe aortic
insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricular
hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequently
underwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valve
repair. Aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration.
One month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacement
with dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess with
cultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated with
amphotericin-B , vancomycin and gentamicin. At this time , he also
required coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. This
hospital course was additionally complicated by development of
third degree heart block necessitating the implantation of a
permanent pacemaker. After discharge , Mr. Nemani did generally
well for the following years until 9/4 , when he again presented
with increasing shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderate
to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At this
time , his aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude's valve.
Again , following discharge , Mr. Nemani did generally well until
4/19 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At that
time , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitation
with left ventricular dilatation ( The systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) ,
along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , and
an ejection fraction of 15-20%. Stress testing at this time showed
a physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what was
done at this time , but apparently his Lasix was increased from
40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. Regarding this
admission , Mr. Nemani reports that he has been feeling fine and is
here in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve ,
or if that doesn't work as it hasn't the last three times , to give
him a new heart all together. He reports no increasing dyspnea ,
fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. He sleeps on three
pillows at night and has not recently been short of breath when
lying flat. He is able to do chores around the house without
getting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath after
one flight of stairs. He doesn't complain of significant
disability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heart
condition. He notes that he has not been able to participate in
the marching band over the last year , but that he can play sitting
down. Mr. Nemani attributes his disease to having been
noncompliant with his Procardia following the cerebrovascular
accident in 1993. He says that , "He brought on his heart problems
himself."
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise , notable for an embolism to his
left foot in 1998 as a result of having
stopped Coumadin therapy , chronic renal insufficiency with
creatinine ranging from 1.4-2.2 in 2/12 , and he is status post
exploratory laparotomy in 1960 from a gunshot wound.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Zestril , which gives him perioral
angioedema.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg b.i.d , atenolol 50 mg q.d. , Avapro
150 mg q.d. , Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg
b.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for heart disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 pack-year smoking history , but quit
one year ago. He has occasional alcohol use.
Mr. Nemani is on permanent disability leave from his job at
Angeles Ny Ral , which involved a lot of heavy lifting. He lives at home
with his wife and 19-year-old son , and spends most of his day
there. He is active in Harcmatche Pkwy. , where he likes to play the base
drum.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: He is a thin , healthy-appearing
black man in no apparent distress. VITAL
SIGNS: Heart rate 65 , blood pressure 120/70 , oxygen saturation 98%
on room air. NECK: His carotid pulses variance and normal in
volume. Jugular venous pressure 7 cm. LUNGS: Clear. His PMI is
vibratory in quality and prominent , lateral to the anterior
axillary line. He has a normal S1 , an ejection sound , and a loud
prosthetic S2 , a III/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border , and a III/IV holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border radiating to the right upper sternal border. ABDOMEN:
Non-distended , with no organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm with faint
pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 , hematocrit
33.5 , with a MCV of 83.5 , RDW of 28.8 ,
reticulocyte count of 6.6 and LDH of 1077. Mr. Nemani had an echo
here that showed severe aortic insufficiency with a severely
dilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of 7.0 and systolic
diameter of 6.3 ) , as well as mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Exercise testing
showed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. On cath , his pulmonary artery
pressure , wedge pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was
47/16 , 13 and 379 , which fell to 26/4 , 5 , and 137 , respectively
with Nipride. His systemic vascular resistance was markedly
elevated at 2400 and a thick cardiac output and cardiac index were
3.62 and 2.31. Amlodipine was then started and Lasix was increased
in an effort to reduce his systemic vascular resistance and
pulmonary wedge pressure. The remainder of the transplant workup
results were unremarkable except for a significantly reduced
diffusing capacity of 59% corrected , a creatinine clearance of 48.4
and a prostate specific antigen of 18.1. Prostate biopsy and bone
scan were both negative. His admission was otherwise notable for
an elevated creatinine to 3.0 in the setting of perioperative
levofloxacin and gentamicin , as well as aggressive vasodilator
therapy. He was allowed to drift back down to his baseline of low
2's before discharge.
Mr. Nemani was discharged home in stable condition on the following
medications:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , amlodipine 2.5 mg q.d. ,
Avapro 150 mg q.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d. , ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: He will follow-up with Dr. Mathew Stautz in
two weeks.
