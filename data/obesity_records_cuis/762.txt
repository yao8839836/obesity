ATTENDING: DOUGLASS PETTINGER MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Congestive iheart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pending.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bloating , abdominal distention.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old woman with a
history of an idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who
presents with bloating , abdominal distention , and fatigue. The
patient's idiopathic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 1990. The
patient had a Chronicle device to monitor filling pressures
placed in 2001 , which has been nonfunctional since 2004. The
patient had worsening symptoms in September 2004 , which led to an
admission for diuresis. She showed evidence of fluid overload on
admission of diuresis with IV Lasix and IV dobutamine. The
patient developed a Chronicle device lead thrombus and was
started on anticoagulation. The patient underwent a right heart
cath in September 2004 , which showed an artery pressure of 10 , wedge
pressure of 25 , SVR 2074 , PVR 326 , and CI of 1.5. Post-diuresis
after addition of hydralazine and Isordil , the patient's RA
pressures were RA=8 , pulmonary artery=50/24 , cardiac index of 2.4
with SVR of 1205. The patient's most recent admission was in
August 2004 with decompensated heart failure , during which time
she was diuresed with IV Lasix , metolazone , and dobutamine and
diuresed 11 liters. The patient also began workup for cardiac
transplant at that time. The patient on this admission describes
one week of abdominal distention , lower extremity edema , and
stable two-pillow orthopnea. The patient describes no PND ,
shortness of breath , or palpitations. She also denies dietary or
med noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Glyburide 10 in the a.m. and 5 in the p.m.
2. Digoxin 0.125 q.d.
3. Probenecid 500 q.d.
4. Multivitamin one tab q.d.
5. KCL 20 mEq q.d.
6. Celexa 20 mg q.d.
7. Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Ativan 0.5 t.i.d.
9. Coumadin 5 q.p.m.
10. Isordil 40 t.i.d.
11. Torsemide 200 b.i.d.
12. Lisinopril 2.5 q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with three daughters. She is
an ex-custodian with past tobacco use but no ethanol use. The
patient's family has no history of cardiomyopathy.
SIGNIFICANT LABS ON ADMISSION: Normal renal function with a BNP
of 1018 and no evidence of bandemia. EKG on admission shows
sinus tachycardia at 105 with normal axis , widened QRS , normal
PR , and no evidence left atrial enlargement , and no change since
1/25 Left heart cath in 1990.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient has no known CAD. She had a troponin at
admission of 0.12 , which subsequently went down to 0.10 less than
assay. It is thought to be secondary to right ventricular strain
with volume overload. The patient was initially started on
aspirin and a statin; however , given her no evidence of CAD and a
normal cholesterol panel , both aspirin and statin were
discontinued.
Pump: The patient presented as "cold and wet" with poor forward
flows secondary to systolic dysfunction and likely increased SVR.
The patient was started on dobutamine for improved inotrope.
The patient was also put on a Lasix strip for diuresis after a
loading dose. The patient was maintained on Isordil and
hydralazine for pre and afterload reduction. Her ACE inhibitor
was held while on the Lasix strip. Metolazone also was used to
improve diuresis , and the patient was maintained on digoxin with
level checks every three days. The patient underwent an echo ,
which showed an EF of 15% , global akinesis with
moderate-to-severe MR , moderate TR , and no evidence of
dyssynchrony. The patient had moderate-to-severe RV dysfunction.
Rhythm: The patient was maintained on telemetry , especially
given the fact that she had no ICD in place. EP was consulted
and evaluated the patient for both an ICD and biventricular pacer
given no evidence of dyssynchrony on echo , it was decided that
the patient would undergo ICD placement only.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.1 on admission and was
monitored closely with diuresis. On admission , she had a normal
UA.
3. Heme: The patient was placed on heparin instead of Coumadin
for Chronicle device lead thrombus with a PTT goal of 60-80. The
patient's platelets dropped from 222 to 166 during this admission
and tests were ordered for the HIT antibody. The patient's
platelets normalized , but unfortunately , the PF4 was positive.
It was felt that this was a false positive and this was confirmed
with a Heme consult. Heme recommended rechecking the PF4 in
three to four weeks and holding heparin products until the PF4
was rechecked. The patient would be restarted on Coumadin after
her ICD placement.
4. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on sliding scale
insulin and Lantus for diabetes management.
5. GI: The patient had right upper quadrant pain on admission
likely related to a congested liver. A right upper quadrant
ultrasound showed a normal liver with thickened gall bladder
walls and ascites , and her symptoms were improved with diuresis.
The patient was maintained on Nexium for prophylaxis.
6. Psych: The patient was continued on citalopram and Ativan
for depression and anxiety. Psych was consulted for assistance
with management.
7. Musculoskeletal: The patient was maintained on probenecid
for gout.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient was on PPI and heparin until she
was on the HIT positive and was placed on Pneumoboots for
prophylaxis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: To be determined at the time of
discharge.
