ATTENDING: POPOVIC , ALEXANDRA MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Cough , nausea , vomiting , and chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease , diabetes , hypertension , CHF , and COPD who was admitted
on 2/21/05 after presenting to the emergency department
complaining of three weeks of feeling unwell. The patient states
that approximately three weeks prior to admission , she developed
increased lower extremity edema. She also noted increased cough
and shortness of breath. Approximately two weeks prior to the
admission , she doubled her Lasix dose without much improvement in
her symptoms. About one week prior to the admission , she began
to have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She continued to
have cough and shortness of breath at this time. The evening
prior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , which
radiated to her arm x1 hour. This pain improved after taking two
sublingual nitroglycerin tables. She presented to the emergency
department the following day complaining of shortness of breath
and fatigue.
In the emergency department , the patient's vital signs were noted
to be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with O2 sat 98%
on room air. She was complaining of shortness of breath and
fatigue. Her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to
77/48. At this time , she was bolused with IV fluids ,
approximately 1.5 to 2 liters. Following the fluid bolus , she
developed wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. However , she
became more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressure
continued to fall. Dopamine was started for blood pressure
support. When she continued to desaturate into the 80% range and
she was subsequently intubated. An echocardiogram at the bedtime
showed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. In
addition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5.
She had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonary
edema. She was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and was
transferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiac
cath laboratory. In the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the LIMA
to the LAD and SVG to OMB were noted to be patent. However , all
the other grafts were occluded. No interventions were
undertaken. She was also noted to have elevated right and
left-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a mean
pulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40.
She was subsequently transferred to the CCU where she was also
noted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very small
amounts of urine. A pH at that time was 7.13. Her cardiac
output , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. She was treated with
sodium bicarb and Lasix IV drip. Overnight , she developed a
brisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. An echocardiogram
obtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejection
fraction of 45%. The entire inferior wall was noted to be
akinetic. The posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. Global
right ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. She
was also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve with
severe mitral regurgitation.
Her CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , one
drawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which she
was started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillin
for Coag-negative staph bacteremia. She was also diagnosed with
a UTI and started on levofloxacin. She was eventually extubated
on 11/18/05. She was discharged from the CCU on 10/30/05 , and
was accepted on to the Cards Pines Service.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Following discharge from the Coronary Care
Unit: In summary , the patient is a 64-year-old female , admitted
on 2/21/05 , complaining of subacute progressive symptoms of CHF
in addition to a more acute onset of nausea and vomiting. She
presented to the emergency department hypotensive , which was
probably related to dehydration due to decreased p.o. intake as
well as continued Lasix use. When given IV fluids , she went into
flash pulmonary edema , requiring transfer to the CCU and
intubation. The patient underwent emergent cath , which showed no
new intervenable disease , but did show severe MR. She was
admitted to the CCU where she was aggressively diuresed and
weaned of the vent. She was transferred to the floor on
4/13/05.
Her hospital course by system is as follows.
Cardiac ischemia. The patient underwent catheterization on
2/21/05 , which showed 100% obstruction in the SVG to RCA graft ,
60% obstruction in the RIMA to the marginal 1 graft , patent LIMA
to the LAD , and patent SVG to OM1 and OM2. Note was made of
markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. No
stents were placed. We continued management of her ischemia with
aspirin , beta-blocker , Lipitor , and Imdur. In addition , we
started an ACE inhibitor , which had been initially held due to
her hypotension. This was restarted on 10/30/05 for afterload
reduction , given her severe mitral regurgitation. Over the
course of her CCU stay and her hospital stay on the Cardiac
Service , she continued to clinically improve. We felt that her
mitral regurgitation was likely dynamic , related to her CHF flare
and ischemia. We would recommend outpatient echo for further
follow-up of her mitral regurgitation.
Rhythm. The patient at baseline has paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , on Coumadin. Here , she was noted to be in normal
sinus rhythm. Her Coumadin dose was held for two nights from
10/30/05 to 6/5/05 for planned TEE echo and a small dose of
vitamin K was given. Subsequently , the TEE was later canceled.
We are therefore restarting the patient on her home dose of
Coumadin , but her INR may rise somewhat slowly due to the vitamin
K. We have asked her to have her labs checked on 9/13/05 for an
INR check.
Infectious disease. The patient was noted to have two positive
cultures for Coag-negative staph , one drawn on 2/21/05 and one
drawn on 5/29/05. She was initially started on vancomycin on
2/30/05 and then switched to nafcillin based on her
sensitivities. The plan was to obtain a TEE to evaluate her for
endocarditis. However , on further review of the sensitivity , we
conclude that two bottles represent two different Coag-negative
staph species. We feel that this most likely represents
contamination rather than true bacteremia. This was discussed
with the ID fellow who agreed with our assessment. Therefore ,
the TEE was discontinued and antibiotics were also discontinued.
We asked that the patient have surveillance blood cultures
checked on 9/13/05 while off all antibiotics.
The patient also had a positive UA while in the CCU and was
started on levofloxacin for a UTI. However , her urine cultures
never grew an organism. So , this was discontinued on 6/16/05.
Pulmonary. The patient has a history of COPD. She was continued
on her home inhalers as well as nebulizers as needed. She
received one course of pulse dose steroids while in the CCU for
presumed COPD infection. This was discontinued prior to her
admission to the floor.
Renal. On presentation , the patient had evidence of acute renal
failure with creatinine elevated at 2.3. However , this improved
with diuresis. She also had an MRI of the kidneys to evaluate
for renal artery stenosis on 6/16/05. This showed severe
diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta , but no
renal artery stenosis. The radiologist recommends a CT angiogram
for further work if clinically indicated as an outpatient.
Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and is on
Lantus and metformin at home. Here , we held her metformin dose
and treated her instead with insulin sliding scale and Lantus.
We have asked the patient to restart her metformin upon
discharge.
FEN. The patient's goal in's and out's should be even to -500 ml
per day. We increased her home Lasix dose from 80 mg daily to 80
mg in the morning and 40 mg at night. These doses should be
subsequently adjusted to maintain her volume status as an
outpatient.
Code. Status is full code.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home on 1/7/05 with
VNA Services. VNA should assist the patient with her medications
as well as volume status checks , daily weights , and lung exams.
She has a follow-up appointment already scheduled with her
primary care doctor , Dr. Nuessle , on 9/29/05 at 2:30 p.m. In
addition , Dr. Tricoche of the Cardiology Service will see
the patient as an outpatient. The exact appointment time and
date are pending at the time of this dictation. The office has
indicated that they will call the patient for a specific
appointment time.
