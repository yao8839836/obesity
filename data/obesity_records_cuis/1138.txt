BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Chief Complaint: Left arm numbness and confusion
HPI: This is a 72 year old female with a history of DM and HTN who
was brought in by her family after transient sensation and confusion.
According to patient , while on her way back from her sleep apnea clinic
appointment , she felt a sudden pressure from her 'head down.' She had
been holding onto a strap on the bus with her left hand and suddenly
felt unable to hold on any longer and she felt tingling on her left arm.
While this was happening , she also became acutely confused and didn't
recognize her own neighborhood or even the house across from hers. She
was able to stand up and walk off of the bus as well as up five steps on
her front porch with assistance from the bus driver. By the time she
reached the front porch , 5 minutes after her symptoms started , she was
back to her normal self. At no time during this did she experience
headache , dizziness , vision/hearing changes , abnormal smell or nausea.
Her other extremities were not involved. She also never lost
consciousness.
