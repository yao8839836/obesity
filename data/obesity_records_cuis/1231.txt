Discharge Date: 10/26/2002
FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. OSTEOARTHRITIS.
4. SECOND DEGREE AV BLOCK.
5. OBESITY.
PROCEDURE:
1. Chest x-ray.
2. Dobutamine MIBI.
3. Echocardiogram.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year-old woman
with a history of hypertension ,
asthma , congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease who
has left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular dysfunction.
She presented to the I Warho Hospital emergency room
department with two weeks of cough and two days of multiple
episodes of emesis and diarrhea. The review of systems was
otherwise negative.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram in
October of 2000 showed mild to moderate
left ventricular dysfunction , septal apical hypokinesis , and
abnormal septal motion. Coronary artery disease. Dobutamine MIBI
in October of 2000 showed small fixed apical inferior defect , mild
ischemia in the lateral wall. Hypertension. Asthma. Morbid
obesity. Hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS: Atrovent , Flovent , Serevent , Vioxx , Zocor , Lopressor ,
Lasix , Losartan , aspirin , nitroglycerin.
ALLERGIES: Lisinopril.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with two daughters and granddaughter.
Never smoked. No alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.8 , heart rate
120 , blood pressure 215/91 , respiratory rate
22 , oxygen saturation 93% on room air. The physical examination is
notable for morbid obesity. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema.
LABORATORY DATA: WBC 7 , hematocrit 45.5 , platelet count 211 , 000.
Chem-7 within normal limits. ECG: No acute
changes. Chest x-ray: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
SUMMARY: This is a 62 year-old woman admitted with two weeks of
dry cough , malaise , and resolving gastrointestinal
symptoms suspicious for a slowly resolving viral infection coupled
with mild congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction while in the hospital. The
patient had multiple nocturnal episodes of bradycardia and second
degree heart block with occasional irregular PR intervals. These
episodes were mostly asymptomatic although she did suffer one
episode of flash pulmonary edema on 1/21/02. Echocardiogram was
done in the hospital which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with
no wall motion abnormalities and mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Dobutamine MIBI was also performed and this showed no
ischemia. The electrophysiology service was consulted and they
determined that the patient was not a candidate for pacing. While
she was in the hospital , the patient enjoyed excellent diuresis on
IV Torsemide and was discharged on p.o. Lasix.
Pulmonary: The patient had a persistent cough which improved with
diuresis and with a five day course of levofloxacin to treat
possible bacterial bronchitis. Nocturnal oxygen saturation monitor
revealed likely obstructive sleep apnea with episodic desaturations
to as low as 57%. These episodes of desaturation were coupled with
second degree AV block as mentioned above. The patient was started
on C-PAP , however , she did not tolerate and refused to use as outpatient.
Gastrointestinal: The patient's nausea and vomiting resolved
following admission.
