air , increased to 95% on 2 L nasal cannula. The patient jugular

HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient was given
increasing doses of Lopressor for rate control of
her atrial fibrillation up to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. On 2/6/02 the
patient was found with a heart rate in the 30s. It was then
decreased to the 20s and the patient was presyncopal. A code blue
was called. The patient was treated with atropine and
transthoracic pacing and Dopamine for hypotension. The patient was
intubated for airway protection. She weaned slowly off the vent in
the cardiac care unit , was extubated on 9/14/02 and transferred to
the floor on 3/20/02 . On the floor the patient was convalescing ,
diuresing with Lasix 40 mg IV p.r.n. for a goal of 500-1 , 000 cc
negative each day. This IV dose was changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.

contraction on glyc improved with regard to correcting her
intravascular volume status. She was maintained on low salt diet
and lytes were repleted p.r.n. The patient was kept on regular NPH
doses with CZI sliding scale p.r.n. Although morning sugars ranged
