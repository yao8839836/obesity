HPI:
62M h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p cardiac transplant in October 2000
c/b allograft CAD , DM , HTN. He has been doing well in his USOH until he
developed nausea and vomiting 2 days prior to admission. No unusual
foods , no sick contacts. He had some "discomfort" in his stomach on
Monday that seemed to get better briefly before he developed diarrhea and
vomiting. The following day he felt weak , didn't get out of bed and had
watery non-bloody diarrhea with ~ 10 BMs throughout the day , and NBNB
emesis. On AM of admission he still felt poorly and came to the ED. Poor
po intake. He has had no orthopnea , PND , lower extremity edema and denies
palpitations , lightheadedness , or syncope. His review of systems is
negative in detail with no recent history of fever , chills , nausea , or
neurologic symptoms.
In the ED he received a bolus on NS 500cc and has felt better without any
N/V/D and feels like "he could lift a cow". He had cardiac enzymes sent
which revealed a TnI of 0.06 and 2nd set 0.09. He is admitted to trend
his cardiac enzymes and for Dobutamine stress test in the morning.
