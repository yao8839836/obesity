Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: OGDEN , LATORIA M.D.
REASON FOR ADMISSION: Ms. Vissman was a transfer from Put Wathern Hospital for further management of severe hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Vissman is a 72-year-old woman
with a history of diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia ,
peripheral vascular disease , carotid stenosis status post
bilateral carotid endarterectomies in 1996 , chronic kidney
disease , and renal artery stenosis , with a history of multiple
strokes in the past and recent admission to Totin Hospital And Clinic
in October for evaluation of multiple embolic strokes after
presenting with weakness. She had an extensive evaluation at
that time given her history of multiple strokes including: Echo
with bubble study ( negative for PFO or intraventricular clot ) , EF
60-65% , no transesophageal echo was done at that time , CRP and
ESR were elevated , and she has been worked up for vasculitis in
the past , which had been nonrevealing. She was started on niacin
given her elevated lipoprotein A. There was no clear
etiology found for her multiple CVAs. She was discharged to
rehab on 9/18/07 where she had been able to ambulate with a
walker.
On 3/3/07 , Physical Therapy came to the patient's bedside at
rehab and found her unresponsive. Blood pressure was found to be
elevated at 210/120. Clonidine 0.2 mg and Lopressor 25 mg were
given and her blood pressure remained elevated at 200/100. She
was transferred to the Emergency Department at Put Wathern Hospital .
At that time , she denied any lightheadedness , chest pain ,
palpitations or shortness of breath prior to this episode and she
did not remember the episode. No focal weakness or changes in
sensation , no vision changes.
On review of systems , she denied any fevers or chills ,
diaphoresis , recent URI , nausea , vomiting or diarrhea , abdominal
pain or dysuria. Head CT at outside hospital reportedly revealed
an old left PCA distribution infarct. Brain MRI revealed tiny
foci of restricted diffusion in the high left frontal region ,
which was thought could indicate a small acute embolic infarct.
Extensive periventricular white matter changes and an old left
PCA infarct were seen. There was no hemorrhage. MRA was normal.
Neck MRI 8/29/07 without contrast revealed moderate focal
stenosis in the proximal left ICA , question small thrombus within
the proximal right ICA. Cardiology , Neurology , Renal and
Vascular Surgery consultations were obtained at the outside
hospital. She had severe hypertension during her admission
there , which was difficult to control and headache that was
treated with Tylenol , Motrin , and morphine IV. Systolic blood
pressures ranged between 117 and 220. Her medications were
adjusted and during that admission , she was started on topical
nitroglycerin , Lopressor , minoxidil and Norvasc. She was
transferred to Pagham University Of for further
evaluation given that most of her recent prior medical care had
been here.

Her right triceps were 4/5 , left triceps 4+/5 , biceps 4+/5
bilaterally. Strength was 4-/5 in her bilateral hip flexors ,
dorsi and plantar flexion. She had no hyperreflexia in her
biceps or her patella. She had some right-sided dysmetria on
finger-nose-finger.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Sodium was 133 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 21 , BUN 30 , creatinine was elevated at 2.6. Her
creatinine had been 1.8 in 8/4 , glucose 217 , white count was
7.35 with 63% neutrophils , 26% lymphocytes , 5% monocytes and 6%
eosinophils. Hematocrit was 34 , which was increased from 27 in
October . Platelets were elevated at 503 , 000. They had been
509 , 000 in October as well. LFTs were within normal limits.
Albumin was 3.6 , which is increased from 3 in October . EKG
revealed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 75. There was no
change from prior.
Chest x-ray on admission revealed a linear opacity in the lower
third of the left lung that is consistent with scarring. Lungs
otherwise well expanded and clear , no significant effusions were
seen and the cardiomediastinal contours were stable with a normal
size heart , calcification in the arch the aorta and mildly
tortuous descending aorta.
The patient had had an echo in the past , 3/6/07 , that revealed
an ejection fraction of 60-65% with evidence of impaired
relaxation. She had an echo on 10/6/07 that was negative for
any intracardiac shunt. She had also had a Holter monitor in
October that revealed a few short runs of SVT that were most
likely atrial tachycardias , but there was no atrial fibrillation.
STUDIES DONE SINCE ADMISSION: Carotid ultrasound 11/23/07 . This
revealed an 80-85% stenosis of mid right internal carotid artery.
There was no evidence of hemodynamically significant disease in
the left carotid artery.
MR brain 6/28/07 . This revealed:
1. Multifocal peripheral cortical infarcts of different ages and
bilateral anterior and posterior circulations with newly
developed foci of acute infarct between 1 and 14 days days old
that suggests ongoing embolism. Cardiac , aortic or carotid
source of emboli should be considered.
2. Focal moderate stenosis or thrombus in the proximal right
ICA. Cervical CTA to evaluate further if indicated.
3. Moderate focal stenosis of the proximal left subclavian
artery and left vertebral artery origin as described , no
visualization of the proximal and mid segment of the nondominant
right vertebral artery as described.
8/20/07 echocardiogram: the left ventricle is normal in size ,
overall left ventricular function is normal. The estimated
ejection fraction is 55-60%. There were no regional wall motion
abnormalities. There was no left ventricular thrombus detected.
The aortic root size was normal. There was no cardiac source of
embolus identified and compared with prior study on 4/18/07 and
10/6/07 , there was no significant change.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Vissman is a 72-year-old woman with
multiple medical problems including severe vasculopathy ( carotid
stenosis and renal artery stenosis status post renal artery stent
placement in 8/4 ) , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia and
multiple strokes. She was admitted to an outside hospital with
unresponsiveness. She was transferred here for management of her
severe hypertension and worsening kidney function. During this
hospital admission , her medications were adjusted. Initially ,
the nitro paste was stopped. The Lasix was held. Her minoxidil
was also stopped as well. She was continued on clonidine 0.2 mg
p.o. b.i.d. and Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily. Lopressor was also
stopped during this hospital admission and labetalol was started ,
which was titrated up by the time of this dictation. Her
antihypertensives include labetalol 300 mg p.o. q.8 h. , Norvasc
10 mg p.o. daily and clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d. It is very
important that the patient receive her medications at their
scheduled times or her blood pressure will rise. She continued
to complain of headache , particularly on the right side and as
detailed above carotid ultrasound revealed a tight right internal
carotid artery stenosis. Vascular Surgery was consulted and she
is currently scheduled to have a left endarterectomy on Friday ,
1/21/07 after which point she will be cared for by the Vascular
Surgery Service. Given the patient's kidney disease and severe
hypertension in addition to recent renal artery stent placement ,
Nephrology was consulted as well during her hospital stay. It
was felt that there was no need for intervention regarding her
renal arteries or visualization of her kidneys at this time.
They agreed with holding the furosemide and changing Lopressor to
labetalol and titrating up labetalol as needed. Her clonidine
could also be titrated up by 0.1 mg increments should she need
more blood pressure control in the future , if her heart rate
does not tolerate higher doses of labetalol. The patient's
creatinine on admission was 2.6 , which subsequently decreased to
2 , however , at the time of this dictation has increased to 2.6
and it is thought that this may be a result of improved blood
pressure control and may be a new baseline; her creatinine will
need to be followed. The patient also has a history of diabetes
and is on insulin and her insulin regimen including NPH and AC
coverage were titrated during this hospital admission.
Hemoglobin A1c was checked during this hospital admission and it
was 6.4. TSH was checked as well and it was within normal
limits.
