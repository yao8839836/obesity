OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: FLEXIBLE CYSTOSCOPY , LEFT EXTERNAL
URETERAL STENT PLACEMENT , REPAIR OF
LEFT DISTAL URETERAL STRICTURE
( BOARI FLAP ) BY DR. RUNYONS , ERMA SHERILL
ON 9 of September INTERNALIZATION OF LEFT
STENT BY DR. RUNYONS , ERMA SHERILL ON
12 of November
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61 year old female
who underwent a left ureteral
lithotomy in 1985. She subsequently developed a left ureteral
stricture at the pelvic brim , which was balloon dilated in 18 of November
The patient received 2-1/2 years of relief , but the presented with
left flank pain and left hydronephrosis in 23 of September She had relief
with a left percutaneous nephrostomy , and later another balloon
dilatation. She had a third balloon dilatation in 7 of March , and this
was of a 4-centimeter segment. A stent was left in place. The
stent presently is within the ureter. The patient now presents for
the above-mentioned procedure. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as above.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY was as above , plus thyroid cyst excision ,
liposuction of bilateral lower extremities , cholecystectomy ,
appendectomy , vein stripping , carpal tunnel release bilaterally ,
and tubal ligation. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Levothyroxine
0.025 milligrams 2 tablets per day , Motrin as needed , Tylenol as
needed , Percocet as needed. ALLERGIES included penicillin which
caused a rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese female in no acute
distress. Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat
examination was clear. Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Back has no costovertebral angle tenderness. Lungs were clear.
Heart had regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen was obese , soft ,
nondistended , nontender , good bowel sounds , multiple surgical scars
along the abdomen which were well-healed. Rectal examination
showed increased tone , tender secondary to hemorrhoid. Neurologic
examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , hematocrit was 29.7 ,
prothrombin time 11.8 , partial
thromboplastin time 21.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 25 of June , for a
procedure on 9 of September She underwent the
above-mentioned procedure without difficulty. The patient did lose
1 liter of blood , however , and received 2 units of autologous
packed red blood cells as well as 4 , 000 cc of lactated Ringer's and
2 , 000 cc of Hespan and 500 cc of albumin. In the operating room ,
they found the left distal ureteral stricture , approximately 8
centimeters with a small stone cluster. The patient left the
operating room in stable condition with a Foley to gravity , a
7-French single pigtail external ureteral stent , as well as a
Jackson-Pratt drain to suction. Postoperatively , the patient did
well. She did have a low hematocrit in the immediate postoperative
period requiring 2 units of blood. Her level was 21.9. Otherwise ,
electrolytes were stable and the patient was doing well. The
patient was taken to the ward for the remainder of her
postoperative care. We kept her on intravenous antibiotics and
nothing-per-oral until she passed flatus , at which point she was
able to tolerate a diet. Because of the duration of surgery , as
well as her large size , pulmonary toilet was encouraged with the
patient. On postoperative day #3 , the patient persisted with a
fever of unknown origin , again thought to be respiratory as
mentioned above. Cultures were taken and she remained on
antibiotics. Stentogram was done on postoperative day #10. This
showed extravasation of fluid distally in the ureter. Cystogram
showed no bladder extravasation. With that in mind , the Foley was
taken out and the stent was left in place. It was anticipated that
she would be taken back another time for stent removal. The
patient was discharged on 15 of May The external stent had actually
been switched over to an internal stent at the time of discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. CONDITION ON
DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP
with Dr. Yahaira M. Mcmillian , and will call the genitourinary staff
or come to the emergency room for fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting
or other questions or concerns. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were
Percocet and Keflex.
