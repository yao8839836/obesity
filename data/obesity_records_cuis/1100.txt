Romona Ranno , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
End-stage renal disease and osteomyelitis.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , peripheral neuropathy , left
Charcot foot complicated by ulceration requiring partial
thickness debridement on 3/26/06 in the setting of new Aircast
started on 8/21/06 now with a cast applied to the left foot ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemia , spinal
stenosis , anemia of chronic disease , thrombocytopenia , and ascus
6/10 and 11/6
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with chronic renal
insufficiency , baseline creatinine 3.8 , diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , and anemia , who present with two weeks of diffuse
abdominal pain that acutely worsened one day prior to admission
with associated nausea , nonbloody emesis , and chills. The
patient was found to be febrile with leukocytosis in the ED. The
patient had been seen previously in the ED on 10/11/06 at which
time she was treated with a UTI. She was sent home with a
seven-day course of ciprofloxacin and oxycodone for pain. The
ciprofloxacin was renally dosed. The patient reports that she
stopped taking oxycodone and ciprofloxacin. After developing
constipation , it is unclear if she completed her full course of
antibiotics. She currently present with complaints of diarrhea
in the setting of having taken laxative at home. No melena or
hematochezia. The pain is not related to food , urination , or
defecation. She has poor p.o. intake , denies any sick contacts
at home. No recent travel.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Positive for blood sugars ranging from 180-190 , although she had
a blood sugar of 499 on the morning of admission. She has
fatigue but no myalgias , no cough , chest pain , shortness of
breath , no dysuria. In the ED , she was given ampicillin 2 g IV ,
gentamicin 80 mg IV , Flagyl 500 mg IV and 8 units of insulin.
ALLERGIES:
Medication reaction , she has an allergy to lisinopril with
reaction of elevated creatinine at a low dose. To levofloxacin ,
she has reflux and celecoxib gives her dizziness and elevated
creatinine.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She had a temperature of 101 , pulse of 106 , blood pressure
172/71 , oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She was alert and
oriented x3 , in mild distress. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 early systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. She was obese , but had a nontender , nondistended abdomen
with normal abdominal bowel sounds. She was guaiac negative , and
her left foot was in a cast.
PERTINENT LABORATORY TESTS AND RESULTS:
She had a sodium of 127 , corrected to 131 with her glucose ,
potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of 27 , BUN 95 , creatinine 4.5 ,
glucose 329. LFTs were normal , amylase 19 , lipase 8 , negative
keto acids in the serum and urine. Her white blood count was
26.8 , INR was 1.4 , PTT was 36.6. She had a dirty urinalysis.
She had an abdominal CT that showed a non-incarcerated hernia , no
evidence of colitis.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
The patient had a debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06. She
also had hemodialysis initiated on 10/9/06.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious disease: The patient's left foot was encasted by
orthopedics surgery on 2/29/06 with evidence of underlying
infection. Her wound cultures grew MRSA with probes to the bone.
X-rays were unrevealing and MRI showed severe osteomyelitis. In
addition , the patient had an ESR of 109. The patient was thus
put on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl. Blood cultures from
6/16/06 additionally grew gram-positive cocci in clusters which
eventually yielded MRSA. However , surveillance cultures with
treatment on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl were negative.
The patient received debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06.
In the OR , the bone looked necrotic and infected. The bone was
sent to pathology and microbiology , the results of which are
pending. Given the appearance of her bone during debridement , it
is presumed that the patient will need eight weeks of vancomycin.
Because she did have a clear source of fevers after it was found
that she had osteomyelitis , the patient was discontinued off
Flagyl and levofloxacin on 5/6/06.
2. GI: The patient has abdominal pain with gastric emptying
study on 6/16/06 showing 0% clearance at 90 minutes consistent
with severe gastroparesis versus obstruction. Radiology did not
feel that an upper GI series would give further information
regarding obstruction and it was judged to be unlikely given that
the patient has bowel movements and rare emesis. Later on in the
hospital course , the patient was put on erythromycin with a
decrease in her symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting.
The patient did have any evidence of bowel ischemia on MRA.
Later , erythromycin was changed to Reglan on 4/8/06 per renal
request during hemodialysis. There is no evidence of pancreatis
or liver disease and the patient was also kept on Compazine for
nausea.
3. Renal: The patient had , on admission , acute on chronic renal
failure. There was a concern for prerenal azotemia in the
setting of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea. She had a
fractional excretion of sodium which was 0.3% , but it was
difficult to interpret in the setting of end-stage renal disease.
Lasix and Cozaar were held. However , the creatinine continued
to worsen reaching 6.1 on 9/14/06. Renal was consulted
regarding the need for dialysis. On admission , the patient did
have matured AV fistula graft and she was thus started on
hemodialysis on 10/9/06.
4. Hematology: The patient had an INR which was elevated.
Hematocrit was also decreased to 25.5 from 34. She was guaiac
negative and did have any schistocyte. Her LDH was also normal
with her haptoglobin high. It was judged from her iron studies
that the patient was iron deficient. She was put on iron
supplementation. She also was felt to have renal component to
her anemia and she was started on darbepoetin initially and
changed to erythropoietin later during dialysis by renal.
5. Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on aspirin , a
statin , and calcium channel blocker. She started prophylactic
beta-blocker during her hospital course as well.
6. Endocrine: The patient had hemoglobin A1c of 7.8. She was
transitioned to NPH and Aspart during her hospital stay. She had
intermittent problems with hypoglycemia in the setting of being
NPO pending operations and procedures; however , her insulin
regimen was titrated to good glycemic response.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on heparin and Nexium.
8. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: Her IV fluids were
stopped as the patient was oliguric and anuric initially before
hemodialysis. Later on , she was also put on 1500 mL fluid
restriction. Later on during dialysis , her volume status
resolved euvolemia. She was kept on a low fat and low
cholesterol diabetic diet. The patient is full code.
