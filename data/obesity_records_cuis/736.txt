BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: SOB
HPI: This 36 yo woman has a history of asthma and obestity. She presents
with SOB and URI sx. She has previously been hospitalized for asthma , but
never intubated , and has never required ICU care. She was last treated
for an asthma flare one month ago. She has been unable to refill her
advair due to social pressures ( children at home ). She works as a pre-
school teacher and has been in frequent contact with sick children. For
the past week she has had increasing SOB , cough productive of white
sputum , and DOE after 1 block. Peak flow about 450 at baseline , 250 today.
Seen in urgent care and found to de-sat to 85% on RA on ambulation.

A/P: 36 yo woman with h/o asthma , presents with SOB , URI sx , de-sat on
ambulation. Asthma flare most likely , though d-dimer concerning for
DVT/PE.
Hospital Course: The patient was treated with albuterol/advair nebulizers
and prednisone with rapid improvement. She was restarted on Advair , and
written for a prednisone taper for discharge. LENIS were performed which
excluded the diagnosis of DVT. The patient has no further hypoxia and
does not complain of pleuritic chest pain , and the diagnosis of PE is
low probability. She was also treated with 40mg IV lasix for pulmonary
edema seen on her CXR. Her BNP is 24 , which makes systolic dysfunction
unlikely ( recent ECHO shows EF 60% ). She should be followed as an outpt
for serial examinations and placed on lasix if she continues to have
signs of right heart failure suggesting diastolic dysfunction.
Finally , the patient is discharged on levofloxacin + clindamycin as
coverage for her LE cellulitis and RLL infiltrate.
She is encouraged to lose weight , and to follow up with her primary care
physician to obtain nutrition consultation and a plan for exercise to
achieve this aim.
