ATTENDING: BALLER , MAX ZOFIA MD
DISCHARGE DATE:
Presumed to be 10/9/05 .
PRIMARY ONCOLOGIST:
Desirae Marcott , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Pain secondary to a lytic lesion in the right hip.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
Recurrent lymphoma , pulmonary dysfunction secondary to
chemotherapy and obesity.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
In brief , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma
diagnosed approximately eight years ago who has been treated in
the past with CVP and CHOP/Rituxan. She underwent high-dose
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in 6/22 .  Her
transplant was complicated by worsening of her baseline impaired
lung function , and she has been oxygen dependent since the time
of transplant. In 4/9 , she began to have back pain and
eventually was shown to have recurrent or increasing disease in
the retroperitoneum by abdominal CT ( paraaortic at the level of
L2 ). The decision was made to pursue radiation therapy to this
area , which she completed on 10/4/05 . The patient presented
with complaints of pain in the mid lower back radiating in a
band-like distribution around the waist to the abdomen as well as
into the right hip and buttock area. The pain also radiated into
the right thigh with movement for weightbearing. The patient
reports the pain was occasionally associated with numbness in the
right lateral thigh. She denied any radiation of the pain to
below the knee. She denied any numbness in the lower legs , back
or saddle area. She denied any change in bowel or bladder
function.
The patient had fluoroscopic LP on 6/18/05 with a glucose of 69 ,
a total protein of 49.3 , and cytology which was negative. Plain
films of her hip showed enthesopathy of the superior pelvis
bilaterally , lower lumbar spine degeneration , and sclerotic focus
in the proximal region of the right femur. MRI of the lumbar
spine on 8/5/05 showed an irregular soft tissue mass within the
retroperitoneum centered anterior to the spine at the level of
L2 , position posterior to the IVC and right lateral aorta
measuring 4.5 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm; there is a lesion involving the
anterior superior aspect to the L2 vertebral body continuous with
the anterior paraspinal mass with wedging and probable pathologic
compression fracture. No epidural mass.

1. Recurrent lymphoma.
2. Pulmonary function thought to be due in part to BCNU
chemotherapy , currently on 5 liters home O2.
3. Status post cholecystectomy.

Vitals: Temperature 97.6 , heart rate 91 , blood pressure 140/90 ,
respiratory rate 22 , oxygen saturation 97% on 5 liters. In
general , the patient was found to be alert and oriented x3 with
difficulty standing secondary to pain and habitus. HEENT:
Pupils were equally round and reactive to light. Normal sclerae ,
normal conjunctivae. Extraocular movements were intact. Moist
mucous membranes and clear oropharynx. Neck: No
lymphadenopathy , no thyromegaly. Pulmonary: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally with some wheeze at the right base.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Morbid obesity , nontender ,
normoactive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly. Back: Mild
paraspinal tenderness bilaterally. Extremities: Bilateral lower
extremity edema. Neuro: 2/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the left; distal neuropathy.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
At the time of admission , white cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 35.5 ,
platelets 249. INR 2.1 , PTT 45.8. BMP showed a sodium of 139 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 99 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 19 , creatinine
0.6 , glucose 126. LFTs were within normal limits. UA showed 2+
bacteria but no white cells.
In general , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma
who presented for workup of lower back pain recurring status post
XRT to the lumbar spine region.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Oncology: CT of the thoracic , lumbar , and sacral spine on
8/18/05 showed no evidence of cord compression but did show a
compression fracture at L2. IR was consulted on 4/18/05
regarding the possibility of kyphoplasty to this area; however ,
they deferred further treatment , as the pain was thought to be
secondary to hip pathology rather than lumbar spine pathology.
CT of the right hip on 4/18/05 showed a lytic lesion in the
posterior acetabulum with an associated fracture. The patient
was evaluated by Orthopedic Oncology as well as Radiation
Oncology. Dr. Aspen with Orthopedic Oncology deferred any
surgical intervention until the completion of radiation therapy.
The patient started radiation therapy to the right hip on
3/29/05 . The contact in Radiation Oncology is Karlene R Kodish , M.D. , pager number 75551. The plan is for the
patient to complete a course of 18 treatments of radiation to the
right hip. The patient will then have a repeat CT of the right
hip in one month's time and follow up with Dr. Aspen . She has an
appointment to meet with Dr. Aspen on 9/8/05 at 2:45 p.m. Per
recommendations of Orthopedic Oncology and Physical Therapy , the
patient is to be touched down weightbearing on the right leg
( toes only ) and full weightbearing on the left leg. It is
expected that she should be able to undergo physical therapy with
the use of a walker. She should be kept on posterior hip
precaution with limitation of hip flexion and internal rotation
of the right hip.
2. Pain: The patient was seen by the Pain Service during this
hospitalization. Her current pain regimen includes methadone 5
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and 100 mg p.o.
q.8. a.m. and q. noon , MSIR 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. as well as 15-30 mg
q.2h. as needed. The patient was also started on Decadron 10 mg
p.o. q.a.m. given her initial concern for spinal cord
compression. She has been tapering off of the Decadron and will
be discharged on 4 mg p.o. q.a.m. with taper as listed in the
discharge instructions. Once the patient has completed Decadron
2 mg p.o. q.a.m. x3 doses , she should then be started on
prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily per her home dosing for pulmonary
disease. The patient did receive pamidronate 90 mg IV x1 during
this hospitalization.
3. ID: UA on admission was more or less benign , and urine
culture remained negative. The patient was afebrile throughout
her hospitalization. She was given a five-day course of
acyclovir 200 mg p.o. five times per day for concern of recurrent
genital herpes. Given continued complaints of vaginal itching ,
the patient was given fluconazole 150 mg x1 on 10/17/05 to treat
a presumed yeast infection.
4. GI: The patient has a history of constipation secondary to
use of pain medication. She has been having good bowel movement
on MiraLax , Senna , Colace. She has also writing for Dulcolax
p.r.n. for constipation.
5. Heme: The patient is on Coumadin given a recent history of
DVT. She had an INR of 3.7 two days prior to admission , so her
dosing was reduced during this hospitalization. Her INR has been
stable and is at 2.3 at the time of discharge on dosing of 4.5 mg
p.o. q.h.s.
6. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient has a pulmonary
dysfunction with a home O2 requirement of 5 liters. She has been
stable on this home O2 requirement throughout this
hospitalization. She does require CPAP at night for obstructive
sleep apnea.
7. Cardiovascular: No known history of cardiovascular disease.
Echo on 1/28/04 showed an EF of 55%.
8. Endo: The patient is on a sliding scale of regular insulin
while on Decadron. It is intended that this should be stopped
when the Decadron taper has finished.
9. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient had some
hypocalcemia during this hospitalization. She was started on
Tums 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , with good response. She was also given
pamidronate x1 as listed above.
CODE:
Full code.
DISPOSITION:
The patient is being discharged to the Waurancevi Ster Waolk Jer Ny Mont for further
rehabilitation. She has a lytic lesion in the right hip with
evidence of fracture. Per recommendations of Orthopedic Oncology
as well as physical therapy , please limit right leg to touchdown
weightbearing only. The patient should be full weightbearing on
the left leg with physical therapy involving use of a walker.
The patient was stable at the time of discharge. She should
continue with her radiation therapy to completion and then follow
up with Dr. Gaylene Faniel , in Orthopedic Oncology on 9/8/05 .
