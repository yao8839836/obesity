Discharge Date: 8/2/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old woman
with a history of cardiomyopathy who
presents with two weeks of peripheral swelling , shortness of
breath , dyspnea on exertion , and chest pain with exertion. She has
a history of hypertension. She presented in 1991 with shortness of
breath , substernal chest pain , and three pillow orthopnea. She
ruled out for a myocardial infarction back then and was thought to
be in congestive heart failure secondary to hypertension. An echo ,
at that time , showed a moderately dilated left ventricular ,
moderately concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , abnormal septal
motion , and diffuse severe left ventricular contractive function.
She was also noted to have MR , AI , and TR , at that time. An
exercise tolerance test was done and she went for two to three
minutes with no ECG changes , but with chest pain and underwent
cardiac catheterization. Her coronaries were clear , at that time ,
but the catheterization did reveal restrictive etiology with
equilibria of pressures that separated with Valsalva maneuvers.
The patient was also noted to have a hematocrit of 34 with black
tarry stool , at that time , and there was no work up done. The
patient did well for a few years after that and , in 1997 , she had
an echo which showed an ejection fraction of 55%. The patient did
well again until three to four months ago when she began having
shortness of breath. On 9 of October 1998 , she had swelling in her
feet , dyspnea on exertion after half a block or stairs , and chest
pain on exertion. The chest pain was subxiphoid and is a pressure
like pain. The patient also had palpitations on occasions with the
chest pain. The pain did not radiate. After five to 15 minutes of
rest , the pain would go away. The patient does have three pillow
orthopnea , but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and no syncope. She
has no fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or dysuria.
Last Tuesday , she went running for a bus and had shortness of
breath , chest pain , and diaphoresis. After 15 minutes , she felt
better. She came in for a troponin level of 0.01 , she ruled out.
Her cardiac risk factors are diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , obesity , and family
history with mother who died of a heart attack in her 70s. The
patient has new ECG findings with a left bundle branch block.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination , the patient's vital signs
were stable with a temperature of 98 , heart
rate 93 , blood pressure 138/90 , and respiratory rate 20. She was
saturating at 100% on two liters of oxygen. Examination showed 12
cm JVD , positive hepatojugular reflex. Lungs were clear. Heart
was tachycardic with regular rhythm , S1 , S2 , and S3 , as well as a
murmur in the left lower sternal border that was II/VI systolic.
LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray on admission showed cardiomegaly with
changes consistent with edema. The patient also
had a hematocrit of 26 on admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was started on Lasix and also
received two units of blood. The patient
underwent severe diuresis and also had an echo , which showed an
ejection fraction of 35% , diffuse hypokinesis , dysfunction of the
anteroseptal and anterolateral walls , 4+ MR , and 4+ TR , as well as
50 mmHg right systolic pressures greater than diastolic pressures.
The patient improved with transfusion and diuresis. The patient
was also started on digoxin. On discharge , the patient had follow
up appointments with gynecology and GI , as well as her primary care
doctor and the congestive heart failure service.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.day , iron 300 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.day , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.day , and
Prazosin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
