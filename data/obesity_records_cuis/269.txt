PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: APLASTIC ANEMIA , HERE FOR HICKMAN PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Eisermann history dates back to
1976 , when she was diagnosed with
aplastic anemia. She did not have a bone marrow donor match at
that time and was thus treated with steroids without significant
effect. She has been transfusion dependent since 1986 and has
required q.2 weekly packed red blood cell transfusions and p.r.n.
platelet transfusions for epistaxis. She has had multiple
complications of her aplastic anemia , including hemochromatosis ,
bronzed diabetes , history of hepatitis B and hepatitis C positivity
secondary to transfusions , avascular necrosis of both hips , status
post bilateral total hip replacements , chronic shoulder bony damage
( both orthopedic prostheses secondary to chronic steroid use ) ,
history of perirectal abscess with Klebsiella while neutropenic ,
history of multiple Port-A-Cath infections. Her past history is
also significant for status post total abdominal hysterectomy for
high grade SIL in 1997.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Rydolph is a 35-year-old woman with a long
history of transfusion dependent aplastic anemia
with multiple complications secondary to hemochromatosis and
chronic steroid use. She was admitted for replacement of a Hickman
catheter which had fallen out in April of this year. Prior to the
procedure she was transfused with two bags of platelets. She had
one bag of platelets on call to the Interventional Radiology Suite ,
but did not require these platelets. She was also transfused two
units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 23. On July ,
1999 , she had a right internal jugular venous Hickman catheter
placed without difficulty. There were no complications from the
procedure. There is no pneumothorax by fluoroscopy. The tip was
in the proximal right atrium , okay to use. Both lumens aspirated
freely and were flushed with heparin prior to being sent back up on
the floor. On the evening of July , 1999 , Ms. Rydolph began an
infusion of Desferal while in house , watching carefully for signs
of anaphylaxis , as she has not received an infusion in over two
months. After she completes her Desferal infusion , she will be
sent home with visiting nurse for Hickman catheter care and
followup with Dr. Myrtis Vantull in clinic.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home services for Hickman
catheter care and monitoring of CBC.
