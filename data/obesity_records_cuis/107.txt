CHF with EF of 25% , DM , HTN. Pt became acutely sob on 3/18 at rest ,
but then states sob for a few days. No cp , occasional epigastric
burning. +PND , sleeps on 1 pillow , no LE
edema. CV January Cath 90% LAD , 80% Ramus , 80% LCx. EF
25%. No chest pain complaints. +Troponin likely
due due demand ischemia from volume overload. Pt
on ASA , Lopressor which was increased over 2
days , Nitrates , and ACE-inh. Pt will maximize
medical management of CV status , and dialysis done 1/1 .
Cardiology Consult 1/1 for Troponin rising to 2.9 ?if CABG candidate ,
cards suggesting med mgt. Increased the lopressor with goal b/p
&lt;130. Troponin max 2.99 on 1/1 .  RHcath after
dialysis 6/21 showed increased filling pressures
and adenosine mibi on 10/13 showed minimal ischemia
of inferior-lateral wall and ?defect in
anterior wall. Will switch to Toprol XL 200 QD 6/8 p
HD. 10/2 12 beats , and 6/21 7 beats VT. follow

review of Cxr there is ?consolidation LLL. If
spikes then culture and add pna
