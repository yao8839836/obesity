Discharge Date: 7/11/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension.
2. Anemia.
3. Congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73 year old male who
was in his usual state of health until
approximately one to two weeks prior to admission , when the patient
had his antihypertensive medications changed. His nifedipine was
discontinued because of gingival hypertrophy and Atenolol was
replaced. Shortly after that he developed increased dyspnea on
exertion , shortness of breath , especially with walking in the
morning. There was a question of light-headedness. He denied any
chest pain , pressure , or tightness. No jaw , neck or arm symptoms.
No orthopnea or PND. Her also denied visual symptoms or headache.
One day prior to admission the patient was taking a walk and was so
fatigued that he had to stop. On the day of admission the patient
was again taking a walk and was noted by friends to be somewhat
unsteady and diaphoretic. The EMTs were called. The patient was
given Lasix and nitroglycerin with improvement in his symptoms. He
denies cough , fevers , chills , vomiting , melena or hematochezia.
The patient has been taking all of his prescribed medications. No
dietary changes. He notes good appetite , no early satiety. He has
a history of two syncopal episodes in the distant past. On the
morning of the admission the patient has not taken any of his
medications yet.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension diagnosed in 1969.
2. Chronic renal insufficiency , with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 ,
felt to be hypertensive.
3. Cataracts bilaterally.
4. No history of coronary artery disease.
5. Status post appendectomy in the 1950s.
6. Status post umbilical hernia repair in 1945.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 80 mg q d.
2. Atenolol 25 mg q d.
3. Aldomet 750 mg t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking tobacco approximately 40
years ago. Occasional alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: His brother had a heart attack in his late 50s.
The brother also has diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98 , blood pressure
190/98 , pulse 48. O2 saturation was 98% on
two liters by nasal cannula. GENERAL: The patient is an elderly
African-American gentleman , sitting up in bed in no acute distress ,
talking in complete sentences. HEENT: The left eye has a
nonreactive pupil. The right eye has a small pupil , approximately
2 mm , with a clear cataract. There is no icterus. The oropharynx
was clear with gingival hypertrophy. NECK: Supple , with full
range of motion. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was difficult
to assess because of the large neck. CARDIAC: Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base. The carotids were
without bruits. PULMONARY: The patient had bibasilar rales with
expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. ABDOMEN:
Protuberant , soft , non-tender. Normoactive bowel sounds. No
organs appreciated. EXTREMITIES: Edema 2+. Femoral pulses were
2+. There were bruits. Distal pulses were intact. RECTAL: The
patient was heme-negative.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Sodium 143 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 24 , BUN 35 , creatinine 2.0 ,
glucose 144. CBC shows WBC 8 , hematocrit 32.9 , platelets 343 , MCV
approximately 80 , RDW approximately 16. Admission CK was 175.
Troponin I was 0.05. Chest x-ray showed a questionable bibasilar
infiltrates. EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 56. The axis was 20
degrees. The intervals were 0.175/10/96/0.471. There was LVH by
voltage criteria , an isolated Q in lead 3 , biphasic T waves in AVL ,
and a flat T in lead 3.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems:
Congestive heart failure: The patient underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol and subsequently did rule out.
After that he had an exercise echo. The patient exercised for
three minutes on a modified Bruce , achieving a maximum heart rate
of 97 and a blood pressure of 160. The test was stopped because of
knee pain and shortness of breath. Baseline images prior to
exercise showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy , with overall
normal function. There were no resting wall motion abnormalities.
Stress images obtained after peak exercise showed a suggestion of a
posterobasilar hypokinesis. No other wall motion abnormalities
were noted. It was felt that this findings were questionable for
nonspecific finding or ischemia. It was felt that the EKG portion
of the ETT showed no evidence for ischemia. The patient was
diuresed gently with IV Lasix and his shortness of breath improved.
Hypertension: On admission , the patient's blood pressure was
approximately 220/110. The patient was started on IV nitroglycerin
and IV Labetalol in the Emergency Department. The patient was
subsequently weaned from IV nitroglycerin and switched to p.o.
hydralazine and minoxidil , 100 mg t.i.d. and 2.5 mg q d. ,
respectively. The patient had excellent blood pressure control on
these medications. The patient was discharged with close follow-up
in order to titrate these medications.
Anemia: The patient's admission hematocrit was 32.2. Subsequent
hematocrits were very labile , and there was felt to be some lab
error involved. Follow-up hematocrit was in the mid 20s. This was
repeated and was again in the mid 20s. He was transfused two units
of packed red blood cells and underwent upper endoscopy. The
findings were gastritis , with some small erosions in the antrum and
a subcutaneous nodules , which was biopsied. H. pylori studies were
pending at discharge , as were biopsy results. The patient was
started on Prilosec 20 mg q d. and will continue with this for
several weeks. Aspirin was held , as the patient's EGD findings
were felt to be consistent with NSAID gastritis. Iron studies
obtained were not entirely consistent with iron deficient anemia.
The serum iron was low. However , the ferritin and TIBC were within
the normal range. Further workup of the patient's anemia will take
place as an outpatient.
Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine increased
from admission value of 2.0 to 2.5. This was felt to be secondary
to diuresis , and the patient's diuretic dose was decreased. The
patient will need to have outpatient follow-up of his creatinine.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol inhaler two puffs as needed for shortness of breath
and wheezing.
2. Prilosec 20 mg q d.
3. Symvastatin 10 mg q d.
4. Nitroglycerin sublingual as needed for chest pain , pressure or
tightness.
5. Aldomet 750 mg t.i.d.
6. Minoxidil 2.5 mg q d.
7. Lisinopril 80 mg q d.
8. Hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d.
9. Lasix 80 mg q d.
10. Iron sulfate 300 mg b.i.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. He will follow
up with his primary care physician , Dr. Vogelsberg , on
10/1/98 at 9:15 a.m. Condition upon discharge is good.
