Plain films of the hip revealed a nondisplaced right femoral
fracture.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Echocardiogram performed on

abnormality and no evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Her RV was
mildly enlarged , mild left atrial enlargement , no AR , and mild
TR. There was no aortic regurgitation , mild mitral
regurgitation , and trace tricuspid regurgitation.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: In summary , Ms. Englebert is a
67-year-old female status post heart transplant in October 2006
who was stable from a
cardiac standpoint when she tripped and sustained a
right hip fracture. She was transferred from outside hospital in Xand for
surgical evaluation.
Musculoskeletal: The patient is status post right hip fracture.
She went to the OR on hospital day #2 and received a dynamic hip
screw. The procedure was uncomplicated , and the patient was able
to begin weightbearing on postoperative day #1. She worked with
physical therapy and upon discharge was able to ambulate around
the Ron with a walker. She should continue aspirin 325 mg daily
for four weeks after the surgery. There is no indication for
systemic anticoagulation after this particular procedure. She
will receive oxycodone as needed.
Cardiovascular: She is status post transplant with the last
echocardiogram revealing ejection fraction of 60%. She was
continued on her standard immunosuppressive medications. There
was no evidence of ischemia throughout the hospital stay. She
was euvolemic with no evidence of congestive heart failure. She was in sinus
rhythm on telemetry throughout her hospital stay.
Hematology: The patient has a history of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia. She was treated with fondaparinux daily prior
to the procedure and then discharged on aspirin for four weeks
postprocedure. Her hematocrit dropped from 33.5% to 24.9% after
the surgery. She was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
cells on the day after surgery with appropriate hematocrit rise.
She received additional 2 units of packed red blood cells prior
to discharge , and her hematocrit was 30.4% on the day of
discharge. Stools were guaiac negative , and it was thought that
his hematocrit drop was due to the postoperative blood loss as
well as potential hematoma formation at the site of the surgery.
Her hematocrit will be followed closely as an outpatient.

for pain , aspirin 325 mg daily for four weeks after the surgery ,
