HPI: This is an 81 year old female with a history of CVA , CAD , diastolic
heart failure , PAF , congenital non-fused C1 ring who presents with L
sided total body pain , weakness and worsening DOE. Her pain started while
undergoing physical therapy of her L shoulder. She reports balance
problems and difficulty ambulating at home. She has had chronic R
shoulder pain for 5 years , and had neck pain for 2 months. She had a
negative CTA in 6/12 .  She had a neck CT 6/12 which showed DJD. After
second PT visit on Thursday 4/19 she awoke the next morning with severe
pain in L neck and head , her neck pain is worse with extension , and
improved with flexion. She reports pain throughout the L side of
her body but specifically at the location of L LE varicose veins. She
also feels alternating heat and cold on L side of body. She reports
difficulty walking well now because of pain , weakness , fatigue and
dyspnea. She has been taking tylenol for pain and this helps. She also
reports abd pain and nausea , and vomited yellow vomit am of admit. ROS
positive as well for worsening DOE , stable two pillow orthopnea ,
worsening chest pain with exertion , dizziness , lightheadedness , loss of

---
Assessment and Plan: This is an 81 year old female with multiple
medical problems who presents with multiple vague complaints. She likely
has more than one medical issue going on simultaneously.
--
CV:
ISCHEMIA: Pt has known CAD. Worsening angina with exertion. No s/s
of ACS currently. EKG shows no ST segment elevations. Checked set of
cardiac enzymes which were negative. She was continued on asa , statin , BB
-
PUMP: The pt has history of diastolic heart failure. ECHO over one year
ago showed EF 55-60%. It also showed severe tricuspid regurgitation. Her
symptoms of DOE , fatigue , LE swelling , abd girth could also be explained
by Cor Pulmonale or worsening heart failure. A CXR was performed
which showed stable cardiomegaly and no signs of overt edema but
clinically with her elevated JVP , increased abd girth and LE edema
were suggestive of fluid overload. BNP was low at 122 but likely she was
somewhat overloaded. An ECHO was performed which showed elevated
pulm artery pressure of 45 , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , mild to
moderately enlarged R ventricle and moderately enlarged Right atrium. EF
of 60%. These findings are suggestive of potential cor pulmonale. Plan is
to diurese pt as outpt and repeat ECHO by PCP as outpt , then
consideration of cardiology referral. Lisinopril is added as allergy
( hyperkalemia ) , perhaps can be given as small dose with close monitoring.
Defer to PCP. The pt was placed on strict I/Os , daily weights. Avoided
fluid restriction given low BP for now.
-
RHYTHM: The pt has fatigue , dizziness , nausea raising the concern for
dig toxicity. She also has known afib. A digoxin level was checked and
came back at 1.4 which might be slightly high for her renal function ,
age and muscle mass. Her digoxin dose was therefore decreased to 0.125mg
daily. She was monitored on telemetry which showed frequent ventricular
pacing and occasional PVCs.
---
ORTHO: The pt had CT of cervical spine in October '07 for neck pain
radiating to the L , as is her current presentation. The CT showed DJD
but no fracture or other concerning finding. No recent trauma. Her pain
is likely from worsening DJD. Plan conservative intervention with
hotpacks , Tylenol. No further imaging indicated. Home PT planned.
---
NEURO: The pt has hx of CVA but current CTA shows no evidence of
acute CVA. Her Neuro exam is fairly unremarkable despite multiple
vague complaints of weakness , numbness , pain. She was continued on
asa. Neuro exam monitored without focal deficits. Treated headache with
Tylenol. If the pt's overall pain persists , she might benefit from pain
consult as outpt
---
PULM: Pt has no known pulm disease but has been prescribed albuterol
inhaler. If she in fact has pulm HTN , she may have causative pulm
etiology. CXR showed no acute pulm issues. If ECHO suggestive , PFTs as
outpt per PCP.
---
GI: Bowel regimen for constipation. PPI for GERD.
---
ENDO: Pt has IDDM. It is not exactly clear what she takes for insulin at
home because she reports that she only takes NPH once a day despite the
prescription in XSRMC .  She is unclear on her doses or timing of insulin.
She was hypoglycemic upon admission. Check Hgb A1C--&gt; 7.4. She was
started on Sliding scale Novolog and AM NPH for the time being. Monitored
FS which were reasonable. PCP to cont management.
---
FEN: Monitored fluid status. Monitored lytes. Avoided K scale while
on digoxin. Low fat , Low chol , NAS , carb controlled diet
---
PPX: Lovenox
CODE: Full
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. VNA to help with medication reconcilliation. VNA-please go through all
medication bottles in the house and sort out the current ones , help
patient make pill box with most current medications.
2. Digoxin dose has been lowered this admission from 0.25mg to 0.125mg
daily. Lasix has been increased temporarily to BID for diuresis until
follow up with PCP.
3. VNA to check sodium , potassium and digoxin level June .
4. VNA to check BP while on bid lasix. Hold dose if SBP &lt;95 and call PCP.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Monitor fluid status/electrolytes. Repeat ECHO after diuresis. Consider
Cardiology consult for ?Cor Pulmonale.
Monitor renal function and digoxin level.
