Discharge Date: 1/10/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HYPEROSMOLAR STATE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Rule in myocardial infarction , diabetes ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , and
urinary tract infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Emilio Helde is a 65 year-old
woman with a history of hypertension ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , with a history of urinary
tract infections who noted cloudy urine five days previous to
admission with increased frequency but no dysuria. In clinic three
days prior to admission , the patient had greater than 10 to the 5th
colonies of E. coli in her urine culture. Since that time , she
developed left back pain , temperature to 100.0 , chills , nausea , and
vomiting x24 hours.
The patient presented to her primary medical doctor on the day of
admission with a temperature of 98.2 , a blood pressure of 128/54 ,
pulse to 112 , and finger stick equal to 521 with a white blood cell
count equal to 30 , and an anion gap equal to 15. Her sodium
was 128 , CO2 was equal to 20. The patient received one gram of IV
ceftriaxone and 5 units of regular insulin x2.
She denied diarrhea , chest pain , shortness of breath , cough ,
syncope , or palpitations. She also denied previous history of an
MI. The patient had had urinary tract infections previously
including an episode of pyelonephritis at age 7 , she denies a
history of kidney stones , she does take high doses of vitamin C.
Risk for coronary artery disease included age , family history ,
postmenopausal state , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and question
hypercholesterolemia. The patient had a positive stress test in
1997 , and was managed medically. She denied recent shortness of
breath or palpitations. Her last episode of chest pain was
reputedly one year previously , associated with stress of work and
for which she took nitroglycerin. She denied exertion related
chest pain but did admit to calf and "hip" pain with walking. She
denied buttock pain while walking. She denied previous history of
diabetic ketoacidosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: T max 99.3 , pulse 104 , blood pressure
131/60 , respirations 20 , at 96% on room air.
Moderately obese woman lying in bed with chills. HEENT: 8 cm of
JVP. Eyes PERRL and anicteric , neck supple , no adenopathy or sinus
tenderness. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA: Urinalysis - A specific gravity of 1.025/1+
protein/3+ glucose/trace ketones/trace
blood/negative leukocyte esterase/negative nitrates/3-6 white blood
cells/3-6 red blood cells/1+ bacteria/negative casts/1+ epis.
Sodium 135 , potassium 4 , chloride 97 , CO2 21 , BUN 29 , creatinine
1.6 , glucose 459. Acetest positive. White blood cell count 26.48 ,
hematocrit 41.3 , MCV 89.9 , platelets 278. White blood cell
differential with 81 polys , 13 bands , 4 lymphs , 2 monos. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 113 , axis equal to negative to 37 ,
intervals equal to 152/90/450 , as well as old Qs in V1 and V2 , left
anterior hemiblock , left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest x-ray
showed no infiltrate , no effusions , cardiomegaly , or pulmonary
edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's glucose came down quickly with IV
insulin and aggressive hydration. She
unfortunately ruled in for myocardial infarction with peak CK on
4/13/99 of 285 , and peak troponin of 6.15 for which she was
treated with beta blockers , aspirin , and heparin , as well as
Zestril and Zocor. She had some recurrent episodes of chest pain
during her admission following her non-Q wave myocardial
infarction.
She also had an echocardiogram on 4/13/99 which showed an ejection
fraction of 45% , and hypokinesis in the middle and distal
intraventricular septum. She had 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and
preserved right heart function.
On 1/12/99 , she underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a
40% osteo left main lesion and a 40% tapered distal lesion. Her
left anterior descending artery was diffusely diseased up to 50% in
its mid portion. The first diagonal had a discrete 70% stenosis ,
and the second diagonal had a discrete 90% stenosis. The right
coronary artery had a 40% discrete proximal stenosis , the posterior
descending artery had a osteo 90% stenosis. The right circumflex
had an 80% proximal stenosis.
The patient had an exercise stress test on 10/4/99 which was a
modified Bruce. The patient completed a 9 minute test with a
maximum heart rate of 100 , which was 65% of predicted. Her maximum
blood pressure was 156/60. She was asymptomatic with no ST changes
and remained in sinus rhythm. The test was therefore interpreted
as negative for ischemia.
It was thought that the patient would probably benefit from CABG
procedure but it was deferred secondary to patient preference , as
well as her infection. With regard to her infectious disease
issues , the patient was treated with levofloxacin. Her white blood
cell count was persistently elevated. She had one urine culture
which appeared contaminated and her blood cultures were negative
for this admission. She had a pelvic and abdominal CT on 2/1/99
which demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , no evidence of
abscess , and punctate renal stones without evidence of obstructive
uropathy. Her fever resolved.
First it was thought that the patient did have a urinary tract
infection. She maintained relatively benign urinalysis , which was
collected only hours after she received ceftriaxone , it was
difficult to believe that she had ever had pyelonephritis. Because
of her persistently elevated white blood cell count was also
unclear although it did finally decline. In short , the series of
events that led up to her admission appeared likely to be urinary
tract infection leads to tachycardia and demand related myocardial
infarction , and then combination of infection and myocardial
infarction leads to nonhepatic hyperosmolar state. Nonetheless , a
different sequence of pathologies is also possible.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition.
