HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75 year old with a long
history of coronary artery disease who
presents with unstable angina.
The patient has a long history of stable and unstable angina ,
suffered a nonQ-wave myocardial infarction 2 of July
PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: 1978 - myocardial infarction. 1980 -
coronary artery bypass graft with porcine
mitral valve replacement. Saphenous vein grafts were performed on
the LAD , PDA arteries. 1991 - Repeat coronary artery bypass graft
because of recurrent angina , LIMA to LAD graft. 16 of August - Laser
angioplasty. 16 of February - Laser angioplasty. 28 of May - Episodes of TIA ,
seizures and was begun on Coumadin. 1 of May - Abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair , nonQ-wave myocardial infarction by enzymes at
Osri Medical Center .
Since July 1995 he has had worsening of his angina to the point
where he had it several times a week while walking very short
distances. He required prophylactic nitroglycerin before walking.
In the week prior to admission , the angina increased to several
times a day , requiring 2 or 3 nitroglycerins for relief where as
before required only 1.
On the day prior to admission , he had recurrent chest pain which
was unresponsive to nitroglycerin. He presents originally to the
Osri Medical Center ER where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin
and heparin and had recurring chest pain.
He was transferred to Pagham University Of for further
management.
At the Pagham University Of he ruled in for myocardial
infarction with CKs in the low 300s , MB of 29.8. He was taken to
the cath lab where an angiography showed an occluded left
circumflex and an occluded LAD path of the first diagonal and
occluded proximal RCA , occluded saphenous vein graft to the LAD and
occluded saphenous vein graft to his OM and patent LIMA to LAD and
saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As summarized above under significant
problems.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM OSRI MEDICAL CENTER : Isordil 20
t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. , Dilantin
100 t.i.d. , proscar 5 mg q.d. , Hytrin 2 mg q.d. , IV heparin and IV
TNG.
ALLERGIES: None known.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his wife , former employee of the
Clooa Turne Sagcraw Ave.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Elderly , moderately obese man
in no current distress. Heart rate is 63 to
75 , blood pressure 108/64 , R 10-14. HEENT - Within normal limits.
Neck - No jugular venous distention. CV - Regular rate and rhythm
with a systolic 1/6 murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Lungs - Crackles 1/3 of the way up.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission - Normal electrolytes , creatinine ,
CBC - hematocrit 35 , platelets 43 , 000 , PT/PTT
19.2 and 6.1 , respectively. CK were 311 and 333.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the CCU and was taken
to the Cardiac Cath Lab with cardiac
catheterization as detailed above. The decision at that time was
made that his findings were not amenable to angioplasty or to
surgical intervention. He was put on an intra-aortic balloon pump
following catheterization. Medications were increased to relieve
after load and decreased ischemia.
His course in the CCU was notable for continued episodes of chest
pain and difficulty weaning from the intra-aortic balloon pump. He
was seen by the cardiac surgery team and they did not feel he was
amenable to revascularization. In addition , he was not a candidate
for laser revascularization protocol under Dr. Murnane and that
protocol was closed.
On 8 of June the patient was successfully weaned from intra-aortic
balloon pump and did not have further chest pain at that time. He
was at this point using SL nitroglycerin prophylactically. On 24 of June
the patient was transferred to Cardiology Park Service.
On the floor , the patient continued to have episodes of chest pain
up to 2 or 3 times a day which were relieved with nitroglycerin SL.
On 14 of August he had more severe episode of chest pain refractory to 3
nitroglycerin and eventually improved with 6 mg of morphine and 10
mg of IV Lopressor. His pain had occurred at rest and lasted a
total of approximately one hour. After this event , the angioplasty
team was reconsulted concerning the possibility of addressing some
of the patient's cardiac lesions. It was agreed that this is a
high risk procedure but after extensive discussion with him and his
family; both decided to attempt an angioplasty of his LAD lesion.
He was briefly admitted to the UHT for intra-aortic balloon pump
prior to the procedure and subsequently on 26 of November underwent PTCA of
his distal LAD to a 30% residual stenosis. He also underwent PTCA
of his proximal LAD to residual 20% stenosis. He was successfully
and rapidly weaned from the intra-aortic balloon pump and
readmitted to the cardiology Ran Wa Heights service on 16 of August
The patient's subsequent course was characterized by decreasing
episodes of chest pain. He began to ambulate in his room and
subsequently around the Cape A Tempe without chest pain. He continued
throughout final week of hospitalization to have one episode of
chest pain on awakening , always relieved with 1 SL nitroglycerin
and occasionally relieved without any nitroglycerin.
On 24 of April , the patient was in good condition without angina ,
walking around the Cho Lu Cordafranfordette and scheduled to be transferred to Nemode Gatu Memorial Hospital He has also undergone anticoagulation
with Coumadin for his dyskinesis. He is discharged with a good
INR. He has upon discharge a 24 hour Holter monitor that is
pending which was performed to evaluate his pacer function.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mg
p.o. q.d. , metoprolol 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , SL nitroglycerin as
needed , Hytrin 2 mg p.o. q.d. , proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 3
mg p.o. q.d.
He is discharged in good condition to the Nemode Gatu Memorial Hospital and he will follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist ,
Dr. Jackson Part at the Osri Medical Center .
